Since surgical patients are already at higher risk of venous thromboembolism than general populations, this study aimed to determine if patients with peri-operative or prior SARS-CoV-2 were at further increased risk of venous thromboembolism. We conducted a planned sub-study and analysis from an international, multicentre, prospective cohort study of elective and emergency patients undergoing surgery during October 2020. Patients from all surgical specialties were included. The primary outcome measure was venous thromboembolism (pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis) within 30\xa0days of surgery. SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis was defined as peri-operative (7\xa0days before to 30\xa0days after surgery); recent (1-6\xa0weeks before surgery); previous (‚â•7\xa0weeks before surgery); or none. Information on prophylaxis regimens or pre-operative anti-coagulation for baseline comorbidities was not available. Postoperative venous thromboembolism rate was 0.5% (666/123,591) in patients without SARS-CoV-2; 2.2% (50/2317) in patients with peri-operative SARS-CoV-2; 1.6% (15/953) in patients with recent SARS-CoV-2; and 1.0% (11/1148) in patients with previous SARS-CoV-2. After adjustment for confounding factors, patients with peri-operative (adjusted odds ratio 1.5 (95%CI 1.1-2.0)) and recent SARS-CoV-2 (1.9 (95%CI 1.2-3.3)) remained at higher risk of venous thromboembolism, with a borderline finding in previous SARS-CoV-2 (1.7 (95%CI 0.9-3.0)). Overall, venous thromboembolism was independently associated with 30-day mortality (5.4 (95%CI 4.3-6.7)). In patients with SARS-CoV-2, mortality without venous thromboembolism was 7.4% (319/4342) and with venous thromboembolism was 40.8% (31/76). Patients undergoing surgery with peri-operative or recent SARS-CoV-2 appear to be at increased risk of postoperative venous thromboembolism compared with patients with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

We performed an international prospective cohort study including patients undergoing elective surgery in October 2020. Isolation was defined as the period before surgery during which patients did not leave their house or receive visitors from outside their household. The primary outcome was postoperative pulmonary complications, adjusted in multivariable models for measured confounders. Pre-defined sub-group analyses were performed for the primary outcome. A total of 96,454 patients from 114 countries were included and overall, 26,948 (27.9%) patients isolated before surgery. Postoperative pulmonary complications were recorded in 1947 (2.0%) patients of which 227 (11.7%) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients who isolated pre-operatively were older, had more respiratory comorbidities and were more commonly from areas of high SARS-CoV-2 incidence and high-income countries. Although the overall rates of postoperative pulmonary complications were similar in those that isolated and those that did not (2.1% vs 2.0%, respectively), isolation was associated with higher rates of postoperative pulmonary complications after adjustment (adjusted OR 1.20, 95%CI 1.05-1.36, p\xa0=\xa00.005). Sensitivity analyses revealed no further differences when patients were categorised by: pre-operative testing; use of COVID-19-free pathways; or community SARS-CoV-2 prevalence.

However, there is currently no consensus on how best to assess the effects of different learning materials on cognitive load estimates, heart rate variability (HRV), outcomes, and experience in learning history taking and physical examination (H&P) skills.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate how learning materials (ie, VR or 2D video) impact learning outcomes and experience through changes in cognitive load estimates and HRV for learning H&P skills.\nThis pilot system-design study included 32 undergraduate medical students at an academic teaching hospital. The students were randomly assigned, with a 1:1 allocation, to a 360¬∞ VR video group or a 2D video group, matched by age, sex, and cognitive style. The contents of both videos were different with regard to visual angle and self-determination. Learning outcomes were evaluated using the Milestone reporting form. Subjective and objective cognitive loads were estimated using the Paas Cognitive Load Scale, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index, and secondary-task reaction time. Cardiac autonomic function was assessed using HRV measurements. Learning experience was assessed using the AttrakDiff2 questionnaire and qualitative feedback. Statistical significance was accepted at a two-sided P value of <.01.\nAll 32 participants received the intended intervention. The sample consisted of 20 (63%) males and 12 (38%) females, with a median age of 24 (IQR 23-25) years. The 360¬∞ VR video group seemed to have a higher Milestone level than the 2D video group (P=.04). The reaction time at the 10th minute in the 360¬∞ VR video group was significantly higher than that in the 2D video group (P<.001). Multiple logistic regression models of the overall cohort showed that the 360¬∞ VR video module was independently and positively associated with a reaction time at the 10th minute of ‚â•3.6 seconds (exp B=18.8, 95% CI 3.2-110.8; P=.001) and a Milestone level of ‚â•3 (exp B=15.0, 95% CI 2.3-99.6; P=.005). However, a reaction time at the 10th minute of ‚â•3.6 seconds was not related to a Milestone level of ‚â•3. A low-frequency to high-frequency ratio between the 5th and 10th minute of ‚â•1.43 seemed to be inversely associated with a hedonic stimulation score of ‚â•2.0 (exp B=0.14, 95% CI 0.03-0.68; P=.015) after adjusting for video module. The main qualitative feedback indicated that the 360¬∞ VR video module was fun but caused mild dizziness, whereas the 2D video module was easy to follow but tedious.\nOur preliminary results showed that 360¬∞ VR video learning may be associated with a better Milestone level than 2D video learning, and that this did not seem to be related to cognitive load estimates or HRV indexes in the novice learners. Of note, an increase in sympathovagal balance may have been associated with a lower hedonic stimulation score, which may have met the learners' needs and prompted learning through the different video modules.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT03501641; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03501641."", 'keywords': ['cognitive load', 'heart rate variability', 'learning outcome', 'secondary-task reaction time', 'video learning', 'virtual reality'], 'journal': 'JMIR serious games', 'publication_date': datetime.date(2021, 11, 24), 'authors': [{'lastname': 'Chao', 'firstname': 'Yi-Ping', 'initials': 'YP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Graduate Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Neurology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou Main Branch, Taoyuan, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Chuang', 'firstname': 'Hai-Hua', 'initials': 'HH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Family Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei Branch & Linkou Main Branch, Taoyuan, Taiwan.\nCollege of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hsin', 'firstname': 'Li-Jen', 'initials': 'LJ', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou Main Branch, Taoyuan, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kang', 'firstname': 'Chung-Jan', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou Main Branch, Taoyuan, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Fang', 'firstname': 'Tuan-Jen', 'initials': 'TJ', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou Main Branch, Taoyuan, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Hsueh-Yu', 'initials': 'HY', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou Main Branch, Taoyuan, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Chung-Guei', 'initials': 'CG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou Main Branch, Taoyuan, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Medical Biotechnology and Laboratory Science, Graduate Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Kuo', 'firstname': 'Terry B J', 'initials': 'TBJ', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Brain Science, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Cheryl C H', 'initials': 'CCH', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Brain Science, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Shyu', 'firstname': 'Hsin-Yih', 'initials': 'HY', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Educational Technology, Tamkang University, New Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Shu-Ling', 'initials': 'SL', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.\nCenter of Teacher Education, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Shyu', 'firstname': 'Liang-Yu', 'initials': 'LY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Chung Yuan Christian University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Li-Ang', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.\nDepartment of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou Main Branch, Taoyuan, Taiwan.\nInstitute of Brain Science, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan.'}], 'methods': None, 'conclusions': None, 'results': 'All 32 participants received the intended intervention.

The current existing artistic style transfer methods cannot generate satisfactory cartoon-style images due to that artistic style images often have delicate strokes and rich hierarchical color changes while cartoon-style images have smooth surfaces without obvious color changes, and sharp edges. To this end, we propose a cartoon loss based generative adversarial network (CartoonLossGAN) for cartoonization. Particularly, we first reuse the encoder part of the discriminator to build a compact generative adversarial network (GAN) based cartoonization architecture. Then we propose a novel cartoon loss function for the architecture. It can imitate the process of sketching to learn the smooth surface of the cartoon image, and imitate the coloring process to learn the coloring of the cartoon image. Furthermore, we also propose an initialization strategy, which is used in the scenario of reusing the discriminator to make our model training easier and more stable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed CartoonLossGAN can generate fantastic cartoon-style images, and outperforms four representative methods.', 'keywords': [], 'journal': 'IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society', 'publication_date': datetime.date(2021, 12, 3), 'authors': [{'lastname': 'Dong', 'firstname': 'Yongsheng', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tan', 'firstname': 'Wei', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tao', 'firstname': 'Dacheng', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zheng', 'firstname': 'Lintao', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Xuelong', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': None}], 'methods': None, 'conclusions': None, 'results': None, 'copyrights': None, 'doi': '10.1109/TIP.2021.3130539', 'xml': <Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0C0EA6E0>}, {'pubmed_id': '34614240', 'title': 'Draw a Star and Make it Perfect: Incremental Processing of Telicity.', 'abstract': 'Predicates like ""coloring-the-star"" denote events that have a temporal duration and a culmination point (telos). When combined with perfective aspect (e.g., ""Valeria has colored the star""), a culmination inference arises implying that the action has stopped, and the star is fully colored. While the perfective aspect is known to constrain the conceptualization of the event as telic, many reading studies have demonstrated that readers do not make early commitments as to whether the event is bounded or unbounded. A few visual-world studies tested the processing of telic predicates during online sentence processing, demonstrating an early integration of aspectual and temporal cues. By employing the visual-world paradigm, we tested the incremental processing of the perfective aspect in Italian in two eye-tracking studies in which listeners heard durative predicates in the perfective form in a scenario showing a completed and a non-completed event. Differently from previous studies, we compared telic durative predicates such as ""coloring-the-star"" to punctual predicates such as ""lighting-the-candle."" While for punctual predicates, the inferences of telicity (the event has a telos) and of culmination (the telos is reached) are lexically encoded in the perfective verb, for durative predicates, the degree of event completion (visually encoded) needs to be integrated with perfective aspect (linguistically encoded) for the culmination inference derivation. By modulating the interaction of visual and linguistic stimuli across the two experiments, we show that the verb\'s perfective aspect triggers the culmination inference incrementally during sentence processing, offering novel evidence for the continuous integration of linguistic processing with real-world visual information.', 'keywords': ['Aspect', 'Incremental processing', 'Telicity', 'Visual world paradigm'], 'journal': 'Cognitive science', 'publication_date': datetime.date(2021, 10, 7), 'authors': [{'lastname': 'Foppolo', 'firstname': 'Francesca', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Milan-Bicocca.'}, {'lastname': 'Bosch', 'firstname': 'Jasmijn E', 'initials': 'JE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Milan-Bicocca.'}, {'lastname': 'Greco', 'firstname': 'Ciro', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Coveo AI Labs, Coveo.'}, {'lastname': 'Carminati', 'firstname': 'Maria N', 'initials': 'MN', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Panzeri', 'firstname': 'Francesca', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Milan-Bicocca.'}], 'methods': None, 'conclusions': None, 'results': None, 'copyrights': '¬© 2021 Cognitive Science Society LLC.', 'doi': '10.1111/cogs.13052', 'xml': <Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0C0EE0F0>}]"

Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are emerging as a potential preventive therapy, with multiple protective functions postulated. Our aim is to summarise the evidence concerning the role of HMOs in NEC development and emerging strategies to tailor the delivery of HMOs to preterm infants. Most research efforts to date have focused on supplementing preterm infants with simple oligosaccharides, which are structurally different to HMOs and derived mainly from plants. Clinical trials demonstrate limited benefits for NEC prevention arising from the use of these supplements. Alternative strategies under investigation include optimising HMOs for infants receiving donor human milk, concentrating oligosaccharides from donor human milk and from animal milks, as well as more sophisticated synthetic oligosaccharide production strategies. Critically, high quality evidence to support implementation of any of these approaches in the neonatal unit is lacking. Whether it is a specific HMO alone or a combination of HMOs that exert protective effects remains to be elucidated. Further challenges include how best to manufacture and administer oligosaccharides whilst retaining bioactivity and safety, including evaluation of the long-term effects of altering the balance of HMOs and gut microbiota in preterm infants. While several human clinical trials are underway, further research is needed to understand whether a tailored approach to oligosaccharide supplementation is beneficial for preterm infants.', 'keywords': ['breast milk', 'necrotising enterocolitis', 'neonatal nutrition', 'oligosaccharides', 'preterm (birth)', 'very low birth weight infants'], 'journal': 'Frontiers in nutrition', 'publication_date': datetime.date(2021, 8, 17), 'authors': [{'lastname': 'Abbas', 'firstname': 'Safiyyah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Women's and Children's Health Network, Adelaide, SA, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Keir', 'firstname': 'Amy K', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': ""Women's and Children's Health Network, Adelaide, SA, Australia.\nSAHMRI Women and Kids, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia.\nAdelaide Medical School, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.\nRobinson Research Institute, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Makrides', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'SAHMRI Women and Kids, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia.\nRobinson Research Institute, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Klein', 'firstname': 'Laura D', 'initials': 'LD', 'affiliation': 'Business Growth and Innovation, Australian Red Cross Lifeblood, Sydney, NSW, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Grzeskowiak', 'firstname': 'Luke E', 'initials': 'LE', 'affiliation': 'SAHMRI Women and Kids, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia.\nCollege of Medicine and Public Health, Flinders University, Adelaide, SA, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'McPhee', 'firstname': 'Andrew J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'SAHMRI Women and Kids, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Rumbold', 'firstname': 'Alice R', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': 'SAHMRI Women and Kids, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia.\nAdelaide Medical School, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.\nRobinson Research Institute, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.'}], 'methods': None, 'conclusions': None, 'results': None, 'copyrights': 'Copyright ¬© 2021 Abbas, Keir, Makrides, Klein, Grzeskowiak, McPhee and Rumbold.', 'doi': '10.3389/fnut.2021.702888', 'xml': <Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0C0F5E10>}]"

This study investigates the associations between the individual, household and slum-level determinants of children's health and vulnerability to RTIs and GI infections in peri-urban slums in India; an area of research interest at the Childhood Infections and Pollution Consortium.\nThe 2015-16 Indian National Family Health Survey was used for data analysis on children aged 0-5 years. NFHS-4 includes data on slums in eight Indian cities, including Delhi, Meerut, Kolkata, Indore, Mumbai, Nagpur, Hyderabad, Chennai. The outcome variables, having fever and cough (FeCo) and diarrhoea in the last two weeks, were used to define the phenotype of infections; for this analysis fever and cough were measures of RTIs and diarrhoea was used to measure GI infections. Exposures considered in this study include variables at the individual, household and slum level and were all informed by existing literature. Multilevel models were used to estimate the association between exposures and outcomes variables; a prior of Cauchy distribution with a scale of 2.5 was selected when building the multilevel logistic models.\nThe total sample size of the number of children included in the analysis was n = 1,424. Data was imputed to account for missingness, and the original and imputed sample showing similar distributions. Results showed that diarrhoea and FeCo were both found to be more present in younger children than older children by a few months.

We assessed the quality of referee interactions with children during sports competitions in soccer. Based on the developmental theory and research suggesting that interactions between kids and adults are the primary mechanism of their development and learning, we focused on the quality of the referee-player interactions in terms of (1) emotional support, (2) game organization, and (3) instructional support. Twenty-five soccer referees who refereed matches for children aged 9-12 years were recruited. The Referee Educational Function Assessment Scoring System (REFASS) was used to assess the quality of the referee-player interactions. This tool was developed based on Classroom Assessment Scoring System-Upper Elementary. Regarding the REFASS dimensions, the mean scores for positive climate, Sensitivity, behavior management, content understanding and quality of feedback were in the medium range, while productivity and negative climate in the high range. In the case of the positive climate variable, the lowest mean ratings were recorded compared to other assessed dimensions. The assessments of the quality of referee-player interactions obtained for particular dimensions translated into the ratings for the specified domains. The highest ratings were given to game organization (6.0 ¬± 0.8; Me = 6.0), whereas the emotional support and instructional support were in the medium range (4.6 ¬± 1.5; Me = 4.5, and 5.2 ¬± 1.8; Me = 6.0, respectively). Referees are usually not aware of their pedagogical function and the complexity of their respective responsibilities. They are commonly considered to be ordinary technicians and evaluators of performance in competition. Based on the results, a postulate was formulated that referees should consciously perform a pedagogical function in the youth sport. Therefore, it is necessary to train them in educational methods and techniques appropriate to the age and needs of the child. The referees will then be prepared to take actions to prevent negative behavior of players on the field and to encourage prosocial behavior.', 'keywords': [None, 'assessment', 'educational practice', 'observational instruments', 'pedagogical function', 'referee', 'referee‚Äìplayer interactions', 'soccer'], 'journal': 'International journal of environmental research and public health', 'publication_date': datetime.date(2020, 2, 7), 'authors': [{'lastname': 'Firek', 'firstname': 'Wies≈Çaw', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physical Education, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski University of Physical Education in Warsaw, 00-968 Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'P≈Çoszaj', 'firstname': 'Katarzyna', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physical Education, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski University of Physical Education in Warsaw, 00-968 Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Czechowski', 'firstname': 'Marcin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physical Education, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski University of Physical Education in Warsaw, 00-968 Warsaw, Poland.'}], 'methods': None, 'conclusions': None, 'results': None, 'copyrights': None, 'doi': '10.3390/ijerph17030905', 'xml': <Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0A7CF618>}, {'pubmed_id': '29394102\n18996874\n22290584\n26909882\n26633046\n22698924\n18331423\n14998794\n25704784\n10709795\n16861584\n25896115\n22929007\n8115344\n19349559\n26305391\n23006452\n20975725\n21525418\n19349560\n21802571\n8558405\n19413705\n22516551\n19846682\n2810024\n26453367', 'title': 'Virtual Sprouts: A Virtual Gardening Pilot Intervention Increases Self-Efficacy to Cook and Eat Fruits and Vegetables in Minority Youth.', 'abstract': 'To examine the effect of the Virtual Sprouts intervention, an interactive multiplatform mobile gardening game, on dietary intake and psychosocial determinants of dietary behavior in minority youth.\nIn this quasi-experimental pilot intervention, 180 third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade students in Los Angeles Unified School District participated in a 3-week program that included three Virtual Sprouts gaming sessions, three in-school lessons, and three in-home activities, using a nutrition- and gardening-focused curriculum.

We systematically surveyed the global literature on the effects of urbanization on species of family Corvidae (crows, choughs, jackdaws, jays, magpies, nutcrackers, ravens, rooks, treepies) to assess the occurrence of corvids in urban environments and the factors affecting their success. We found a total of 424 primary research articles, and the number of articles has increased exponentially since the 1970s. Most studies were carried out in cities of Europe and North America (45.5% and 31.4%, respectively) and were directed on a single species (75.2). We found that 30 corvid species (23% of 133 total) regularly occur in urban environments. The majority (72%) of the studies reported positive effects of urbanization on corvids, with 85% of studies detecting population increases and 64% of studies detecting higher breeding success with urbanization. Of the factors proposed to explain corvids' success (availability of nesting sites and food sources, low predation and persecution), food availability coupled with diet shifts emerged as the most important factors promoting Corvidae to live in urban settings. The breeding of corvids in urban environments was further associated with earlier nesting, similar or larger clutches, lower hatching but higher fledging success, reduced home range size and limited territoriality, increased tolerance towards humans and increasing frequency of conflicts with humans. Despite geographic and taxonomic biases in our literature sample, our review indicates that corvids show both flexibility in resource use and behavioral plasticity that enable them to exploit novel resources for nesting and feeding. Corvids can thus be urban exploiters of the large-scale modifications of ecosystems caused by urbanization."", 'keywords': ['Corvidae', 'adaptation', 'anthropogenic', 'habitat selection', 'life history trait', 'urbanization gradient'], 'journal': 'Animals : an open access journal from MDPI', 'publication_date': datetime.date(2021, 11, 28), 'authors': [{'lastname': 'Benmazouz', 'firstname': 'Isma', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Animal Husbandry Doctoral School, University of Debrecen, 4032 Debrecen, Hungary.'}, {'lastname': 'Jokim√§ki', 'firstname': 'Jukka', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Arctic Centre, University of Lapland, 96300 Rovaniemi, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Lengyel', 'firstname': 'Szabolcs', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Tisza Research, Institute of Aquatic Ecology, Centre for Ecological Research, E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd Research Network, 4026 Debrecen, Hungary.'}, {'lastname': 'Juh√°sz', 'firstname': 'Lajos', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nature Conservation Zoology and Game Management, University of Debrecen, 4032 Debrecen, Hungary.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaisanlahti-Jokim√§ki', 'firstname': 'Marja-Liisa', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'Arctic Centre, University of Lapland, 96300 Rovaniemi, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Kardos', 'firstname': 'G√°bor', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Metagenomics, University of Debrecen, 4032 Debrecen, Hungary.'}, {'lastname': 'Pal√°di', 'firstname': 'Petra', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Animal Husbandry Doctoral School, University of Debrecen, 4032 Debrecen, Hungary.'}, {'lastname': 'K√∂v√©r', 'firstname': 'L√°szl√≥', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nature Conservation Zoology and Game Management, University of Debrecen, 4032 Debrecen, Hungary.'}], 'methods': None, 'conclusions': None, 'results': None, 'copyrights': None, 'doi': '10.3390/ani11113226', 'xml': <Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x0A7EAB90>}, {'pubmed_id': '34799611\n28004742\n16768826\n32917621\n29942712\n25529670\n25529718\n26972928', 'title': 'Isotopic investigation of skeletal remains at the Imdang tombs reveals high consumption of game birds and social stratification in ancient Korea.', 'abstract': 'Understanding the development of early states on the Korean Peninsula is an important topic in Korean archaeology.

While most female kids are reared to become the next generation of dairy goats, only a small proportion of male kids (buck kids) are reared with reproduction aims. The market for buck kid meat, especially within Northern European countries, is currently relatively small compared to the number of bucks born. Therefore, the purposes for buck kids are limited and a substantial proportion of buck kid meat is used for pet food. Due to the limited economic value of buck kids, farmers are faced with a dilemma. Although raising bucks costs more money than it yields, the birth of kids is a prerequisite for production of milk and should be seen as an investment for business-wise healthy dairy goat farming. In that perspective, dairy goat farmers have an ethical responsibility toward buck kids, as well. In this paper, we compare various scenarios of dealing with the issue of surplus male animals. We provide recommendations for the rearing of buck kids based on the sector's experience and current practice in the Netherlands. Reducing the number of surplus (male) offspring, e.g., by an optimized prolonged lactation management and/or by artificial insemination with sex-sorted semen, could alleviate the issue of low value buck kids. Killing surplus animals before or directly after birth, on the other hand, is met with increasing societal scrutiny. Initiatives to propagate a market for buck kid meat for human consumption are important to enable a suitable and sustainable production system. To maintain the health and welfare of goat kids, amongst other factors, sufficient and good quality colostrum, milk, and an appropriate diet as they grow older, needs to be provided. One option to assure the safeguarding of health and welfare of all goat kids are quality assurance schemes for milk production. These schemes make dairy farmers accountable for the health and welfare of all kids in the rearing period, including the provision of colostrum and adequate care for newborn buck kids. We conclude that the combination of reducing the number of surplus kids, increasing the demand for goat products, and quality assurance schemes that may help to safeguard the welfare of buck kids."", 'keywords': ['buck kids', 'dairy goats', 'farm animal ethics', 'farm animal welfare', 'surplus offspring'], 'journal': 'Frontiers in veterinary science', 'publication_date': datetime.date(2021, 11, 2), 'authors': [{'lastname': 'Meijer', 'firstname': 'Ellen', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Population Health Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Goerlich', 'firstname': 'Vivian C', 'initials': 'VC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Population Health Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'van den Brom', 'firstname': 'Ren√©', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Royal GD, Department of Small Ruminant Health, Deventer, Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Giersberg', 'firstname': 'Mona F', 'initials': 'MF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Population Health Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Arndt', 'firstname': 'Saskia S', 'initials': 'SS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Population Health Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Rodenburg', 'firstname': 'T Bas', 'initials': 'TB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Population Health Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, Utrecht, Netherlands.'}], 'methods': None, 'conclusions': None, 'results': None, 'copyrights': 'Copyright ¬© 2021 Meijer, Goerlich, Brom, Giersberg, Arndt and Rodenburg.', 'doi': '10.3389/fvets.2021.662102', 'xml': <Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x00965D98>}]"
