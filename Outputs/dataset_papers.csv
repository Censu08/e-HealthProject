The objective of this study was to examine head impact frequency and magnitude by levels-of-contact to determine which drills had the greatest head impact exposure. Our primary hypothesis was that there would be an incremental increase in season-long head impact exposure between levels-of-contact: air<bags<control<thud<live. This observational study included 24 high-school football players during all 46 practices, 1 scrimmage, 9 junior varsity and 10 varsity games in the 2019 season. Players wore a sensor-installed mouthguard that monitored head impact frequency, peak linear acceleration (PLA), and rotational acceleration (PRA). Practice/game drills were filmed and categorized into five levels-of-contact (air, bags, control, thud, live), and head impact data were assigned into one of five levels-of-contact. Player position was categorized into lineman, hybrid, and skill. A total of 6016 head impacts were recorded during 5 levels-of-contact throughout the season. In the overall sample, total number of impacts, sum of PLA, and PRA per player increased in a near incremental manner (air<bags<control = thud<live), where live drills had significantly higher cumulative frequency (113.7±17.8 hits/player) and magnitude [2,657.6±432.0 g (PLA), and 233.9 ± 40.1 krad/s2 (PRA)] than any other levels-of-contact, whereas air drills showed the lowest cumulative frequency (7.7±1.9 hits/player) and magnitude [176.9±42.5 g (PLA), PRA 16.7±4.2 krad/s2 (PRA)]. There was no significant position group difference in cumulative head impact frequency and magnitude in a season. Although there was no difference in average head impact magnitude across five levels-of-contact and by position group PLA (18.2-23.2g) and PRA (1.6-2.3krad/s2) per impact], high magnitude (60-100g and >100g) head impacts were more frequently observed during live and thud drills.

Voice call, text message, picture/video message, and all other possible measures were employed to accumulate maximum clinical information in real-time.\nA total of 153 children(95 males [62 %], 9.45\u202f±\u202f3.24 years, 140 lower/middle socioeconomic status) were enrolled after screening 237 children with various neurological disorders, whose caregivers contacted for teleconsultation. A total of 278 telephone consultations performed for these 153 children (1-5 telephone calls per patient). Hundred-thirteen children were identified to have a total of 152 significant clinical events (breakthrough seizure/uncontrolled epilepsy (108), AED related (13), and unrelated systemic adverse effects (24), worsening of associated co-morbidities (7). In rest of the patients, the query of the caregiver included unavailability of AED/prescribed commercial brand in the locality, query related to the dose of drugs, proxy for a scheduled routine visit (no active issues), and concern regarding COVID-19 related symptoms and effect of COVID-19 and lockdown in children with epilepsy. Ninety-three (60 %) patients required hiking up of AED dose, whereas 29 (17 %) patients required the addition of a new AED/commercial brand. Five children were advised immediate admission to a nearby hospital. Overall, 147 (96 %) caregivers were satisfied with the quality of medical advice.\nTeleconsultation is one of the few feasible options with good effectiveness for providing medical advice to children with epilepsy during pandemic times.', 'keywords': ['Antiepileptic drugs', 'COVID-19', 'Child neurology', 'Epilepsy', 'Teleconsultation'], 'journal': 'Seizure', 'publication_date': datetime.date(2020, 7, 28), 'authors': [{'lastname': 'Panda', 'firstname': 'Prateek Kumar', 'initials': 'PK', 'affiliation': 'Pediatric Neurology Division, Department of Pediatrics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, 249203, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Dawman', 'firstname': 'Lesa', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, 160012, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Panda', 'firstname': 'Pragnya', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, SCB Medical College, Cuttack, Odisha, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Sharawat', 'firstname': 'Indar Kumar', 'initials': 'IK', 'affiliation': 'Pediatric Neurology Division, Department of Pediatrics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, 249203, India.

Most studies of grapheme-color synesthesia have only examined synesthetes in English, leaving underexplored the question of how synesthetic phenomenology might differ in languages that do not use alphabets. In particular, grapheme-color synesthesia in an abugida (a segmental writing system in which vowels are added to consonant graphemes using 'accent'-like diacritical marks) has never been studied. Here, we present a case study of a Bengali synesthete, MJ, the first report of a grapheme-color synesthete in an abugida. First, we show that for MJ, diacritics influence the overall color of the consonant grapheme they modify, 'pulling' it toward the color she experiences for the vowel. Second, we describe and analyze the complex synesthetic experiences reported by MJ for conjunct graphemes, a unique orthographic feature of Brahmi-derived scripts (such as Bengali) in which multiple graphemes are visually combined into a single 'merged' grapheme. Finally, we show that in addition to these language-specific features, MJ's synesthetic associations are influenced by some of the same linguistic properties (such as orthography and phonology) that influence synesthetic associations in other languages. We conclude that the idiosyncratic features of MJ's synesthesia reflect unique properties of the Bengali writing system, that more studies of synesthesia in non-alphabetic scripts are needed, and that synesthetic phenomenology can offer insights into how linguistic properties shape grapheme representation in the brain."", 'keywords': [], 'journal': 'Multisensory research', 'publication_date': datetime.date(2021, 3, 12), 'authors': [{'lastname': 'Root', 'firstname': 'Nicholas', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of California, La Jolla, CA 92093-0109, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Bhattacharyya', 'firstname': 'Pushpita', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of California, La Jolla, CA 92093-0109, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ramachandran', 'firstname': 'Vilayanur S', 'initials': 'VS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of California, La Jolla, CA 92093-0109, USA.'}], 'methods': None, 'conclusions': None, 'results': None, 'copyrights': None, 'doi': '10.1163/22134808-bja10036', 'xml': <Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x000002BF3B2A4EA0>}]"

Pleasant conversations are preceded by concerns about starting one.', 'abstract': 'Connecting with others makes people happier, but strangers in close proximity often ignore each other. Prior research (Epley & Schroeder, 2014) suggested this social disconnection stems from people misunderstanding how pleasant it would be to talk with strangers. Extending these prior results, in a field experiment with London-area train commuters, those assigned to talk with a stranger reported having a significantly more positive experience, and learning significantly more, than those assigned to a solitude or control condition. Commuters also expected a more positive experience if they talked to a stranger than in the solitude or control conditions. A second experiment explored why commuters nevertheless avoid conversation even when it is generally pleasant. Commuters predicted that trying to have a conversation would be less pleasant than actually having one because they anticipated that others would be uninterested in talking. These experiments clarify the precise aspects of social interaction that may be misunderstood.

In this paper, we explore an alternative approach to designing Deep Neural Networks for variant calling, where we use meticulously designed Deep Neural Network architectures and customized variant inference functions that account for the underlying nature of sequencing data instead of converting the problem to one of image recognition.\nResults from 27 whole-genome variant calling experiments spanning Illumina, PacBio and hybrid Illumina-PacBio settings suggest that our method allows vastly smaller Deep Neural Networks to outperform the Inception-v3 architecture used in DeepVariant for indel and substitution-type variant calls.

Howhever, many of these apps are released without tests for their effectiveness. This is worrying given that the factors influencing children\'s learning from touchscreen devices need to be examined in detail. In particular, it has been suggested that children learn less from passive video viewing relative to equivalent live interaction, which would have implications for learning from such digital tools. However, this so-called video deficit may be reduced by allowing children greater influence over their learning environment. Across two touchscreen-based experiments, we examined whether 2- to 4-year-olds benefit from actively choosing what to learn more about in a digital word learning task. We designed a tablet study in which ""active"" participants were allowed to choose which objects they were taught the label of, while yoked ""passive"" participants were presented with the objects chosen by their active peers. We then examined recognition of the learned associations across different tasks. In Experiment 1, children in the passive condition outperformed those in the active condition (n = 130). While Experiment 2 replicated these findings in a new group of Malay-speaking children (n = 32), there were no differences in children\'s learning or recognition of the novel word-object associations using a more implicit looking time measure. These results suggest that there may be performance costs associated with active tasks designed as in the current study, and at the very least, there may not always be systematic benefits associated with active learning in touchscreen-based word learning tasks.

Both CSE and CSE+F were assessed with the parent-completed Nutrition and Health Questionnaire; Infant Behavior Questionnaire, Revised Very Short; and Parenting Stress Index, Short Form.\nThe final sample size was 1085 children for the analysis of CSE and\u20091083 children for the analysis of CSE+F. Among 914 respondents, the children's mean (SD) age was 11.6 (2.3) months, and 478 (52.3%) were male. Among 910 respondents, 839 (92.2%) were mothers, with a mean (SD) age among 873 respondents of 34.4 (4.2) years. In a typical week, 581 of 779 children (74.6%) were reported to have any CSE, and 321 of 874 children (36.7%) had some CSE+F. Higher parenting stress levels (odds ratio [OR],\u20091.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02; P\u2009=\u2009.04) and older child age (OR,\u20091.43; 95% CI, 1.01-2.03; P\u2009=\u2009.04) were associated with CSE. Higher parenting stress levels (incidence rate [IR],\u20091.00; 95% CI, 1.00-1.01; P\u2009=\u2009.002) and lower household income (IR,\u20091.26; 95% CI, 1.10-1.45; P\u2009=\u2009.01) were associated with increased CSE. Older child age (OR,\u20091.79; 95% CI, 1.35-2.38; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and lower household income (OR,\u20092.54; 95% CI, 1.72-3.74; P\u2009<\u2009.001) were associated with CSE+F. Lower household income (IR,\u20091.21; 95% CI, 1.03-1.42; P\u2009=\u2009.02) was associated with increased CSE+F.\nThis study found that parenting stress, income, and child age were associated with CSE, and child age and household income were associated with CSE+F.

We aimed to determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children with DS. Using data from an international survey obtained from a range of countries and control data from the United States, we compared the prevalence of symptoms and medical complications and risk factors for severe outcomes between DS and non-DS paediatric populations with COVID-19. Hospitalised COVID-19 patients <18 years with DS had a higher incidence of respiratory symptoms, fever, and several medical complications from COVID-19 than control patients without DS <18 years. Older age, obesity, and epilepsy were significant risk factors for hospitalisation among paediatric COVID-19 patients with DS, and age and thyroid disorder were significant risk factors for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Mortality rates were low in all paediatric COVID-19 patients (with and without DS), contrasting with previous findings in adults with DS (who exhibit higher mortality than those without DS). Children with DS are at increased risk for more severe presentations of COVID-19. Efforts should be made to ensure the comprehensive and early detection of COVID-19 in this population and to identify children with DS who present comorbidities that pose a risk for a severe course of COVID-19.

'title': 'Effects of a Physical Education Program on Physical Activity and Emotional Well-Being among Primary School Children.', 'abstract': '(1) Background: It has been identified that schools that adopt at least two hours a week of physical education and plan specific contents and activities can achieve development goals related to physical level, such as promoting health, well-being, and healthy lifestyles, on a personal level, including bodily awareness and confidence in physical skills, as well as a general sense of well-being, greater security and self-esteem, sense of responsibility, patience, courage, and mental balance. The purpose of this study was to establish the effect of physical education programs on the physical activity and emotional well-being of primary school children. (2) Methods: The experimental group comprised 45 girls and 44 boys aged 6-7 years (First Grade) and 48 girls and 46 boys aged 8-9 years (Second Grade), while the control group comprised 43 girls and 46 boys aged 6-7 years (First Grade) and 47 girls and 45 boys aged 8-9 years (Second Grade). All children attended the same school. The Children\'s Physical Activity Questionnaire was used, which is based on the Children\'s Leisure Activities Study Survey questionnaire, which includes activities specific to young children (e.g., ""playing in a playhouse""). Emotional well-being status was explored by estimating three main dimensions: somatic anxiety, personality anxiety, and social anxiety. The Revised Children\'s Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) was used. (3) Results: When analysing the pre-test results of physical activity of the 6-7- and 8-9-year-old children, it turned out that both the First Grade (92.15 MET, min/week) and Second Grade (97.50 MET, min/week) participants in the experimental group were physically active during physical education lessons. When exploring the results of somatic anxiety in EG (4.95 ± 1.10 points), both before and after the experiment, we established that somatic anxiety in EG was 4.55 ± 1.00 points after the intervention program, demonstrating lower levels of depression, seclusion, somatic complaints, aggression, and delinquent behaviours (F = 4.785, ', 'keywords': ['anxiety', 'physical activity', 'physical educational program', 'primary education'], 'journal': 'International journal of environmental research and public health', 'publication_date': datetime.date(2021, 7, 25), 'authors': [{'lastname': 'Kliziene', 'firstname': 'Irina', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Educational Research Group, Institute of Social Science and Humanity, Kaunas University of Technology, Kaunas 44249, Lithuania.'}, {'lastname': 'Cizauskas', 'firstname': 'Ginas', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Design, Kaunas University of Technology, Kaunas 51424, Lithuania.'}, {'lastname': 'Sipaviciene', 'firstname': 'Saule', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Applied Biology and Rehabilitation, Lithuanian Sports University, Kaunas 44221, Lithuania.'}, {'lastname': 'Aleksandraviciene', 'firstname': 'Roma', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Coaching Science, Lithuanian Sports University, Kaunas 44221, Lithuania.\nSports Centre, Vytautas Magnus University, Kaunas 51211, Lithuania.'}, {'lastname': 'Zaicenkoviene', 'firstname': 'Kristina', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Coaching Science, Lithuanian Sports University, Kaunas 44221, Lithuania.'}], 'methods': None, 'conclusions': None, 'results': None, 'copyrights': None, 'doi': '10.3390/ijerph18147536', 'xml': <Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x000002BF3B3906D0>}]"

We hypothesize that preterm infants who receive creative music therapy during neonatal intensive care admission will have developmental benefits short- and long-term brain function.\nA prospective, randomized controlled single-center pilot trial involving 60 clinically stable preterm infants under 32\xa0weeks of gestational age is conducted in preparation for a multi-center trial. Thirty infants each are randomized to either standard neonatal intensive care or standard care with CMT. Music therapy intervention is approximately 20\xa0min in duration three times per week. A trained music therapist sings for the infants in lullaby style, individually entrained and adjusted to the infant's rhythm and affect. Primary objectives of this study are feasibility of protocol implementation and investigating the potential mechanism of efficacy for this new intervention. To examine the effect of this new intervention, non-invasive, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods at corrected age and standardized neurodevelopmental assessments using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development third edition at a corrected age of 24\xa0months and Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children at 5\xa0years will be performed. All assessments will be performed and analyzed by blinded experts.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled clinical trial to systematically examine possible effects of creative music therapy on short- and long-term brain development in preterm infants. This project lies at the interface of music therapy, neuroscience, and medical imaging. New insights into the potential role and impact of music on brain function and development may be elucidated. If such a low-cost, low-risk intervention is demonstrated in a future multi-center trial to be effective in supporting brain development in preterm neonates, findings could have broad clinical implications for this vulnerable patient population.\nClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02434224."", 'keywords': ['Brain development', 'Creative music therapy', 'Neurobehavioral outcomes', 'Preterm infants', 'Randomized controlled trial'], 'journal': 'Pilot and feasibility studies', 'publication_date': datetime.date(2017, 10, 5), 'authors': [{'lastname': 'Haslbeck', 'firstname': 'Friederike Barbara', 'initials': 'FB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neonatology, University Hospital Zurich, Frauenklinikstrasse 10, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Bucher', 'firstname': 'Hans-Ulrich', 'initials': 'HU', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neonatology, University Hospital Zurich, Frauenklinikstrasse 10, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Bassler', 'firstname': 'Dirk', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neonatology, University Hospital Zurich, Frauenklinikstrasse 10, 8091 Zurich, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Hagmann', 'firstname': 'Cornelia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatric Intensive Care and Neonatology, University Children's Hospital, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland.""}], 'methods': None, 'conclusions': None, 'results': None, 'copyrights': None, 'doi': '10.1186/s40814-017-0180-5', 'xml': <Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x000002BF3B27E270>}, {'pubmed_id': '27531985\n15060216\n15173496\n16817682\n17272594\n17889070\n17974734\n18579757\n19140641\n19254972\n20595440\n20603258\n20630431\n20708572\n20826302\n20833387\n21593996\n21911349\n22007002\n22643165\n22716950\n23044213\n23420910\n23543633\n24615347\n25007059\n25542777\n25985468\n26083848\n26527548\n26699535\n26720437\n28448255\n9578994', 'title': ""Toddlers' Fine Motor Milestone Achievement Is Associated with Early Touchscreen Scrolling."", 'abstract': ""Touchscreen technologies provide an intuitive and attractive source of sensory/cognitive stimulation for young children. Despite fears that usage may have a negative impact on toddlers' cognitive development, empirical evidence is lacking. The current study presents results from the UK Toddler Attentional Behaviours and LEarning with Touchscreens (TABLET) project, examining the association between toddlers' touchscreen use and the attainment of developmental milestones. Data were gathered in an online survey of 715 parents of 6- to 36-month-olds to address two research questions: (1) How does touchscreen use change from 6 to 36 months? (2) In toddlers (19-36 months, i.e., above the median age, n = 366), how does retrospectively reported age of first touchscreen usage relate to gross motor (i.e., walking), fine motor (i.e., stacking blocks), and language (i.e., producing two-word utterances) milestones? In our sample, the proportion of children using touchscreens, as well as the average daily usage time, increased with age (youngest quartile, 6-11 months: 51.22% users, 8.53 min per day; oldest quartile, 26-36 months: 92.05% users, average use of 43.95 min per day). In toddlers, aged 19-36 months, age of first touchscreen use was significantly associated with fine motor (stacking blocks), p = 0.03, after controlling for covariates age, sex, mother's education (a proxy for socioeconomic status) as well as age of early fine motor milestone achievement (pincer grip). This effect was only present for active scrolling of the touchscreen p = 0.04, not for video watching. No significant relationships were found between touchscreen use and either gross motor or language milestones. Touchscreen use increases rapidly over the first 3 years of life. In the current study, we find no evidence to support a negative association between the age of first touchscreen usage and developmental milestones. Indeed, earlier touchscreen use, specifically scrolling of the screen, was associated with earlier fine motor achievement. Future longitudinal studies are required to elucidate the temporal order and mechanisms of this association, and to examine the impact of touchscreen use on other, more fine-grained, measures of behavioral, cognitive, and neural development.

We conducted a comprehensive corpus analysis of German child-directed speech (CDS) using data from the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES) database, investigating the availability of word stress, transitional probabilities (TPs), and lexical and sublexical frequencies as potential cues for word segmentation. Seven hours of data (~15,000 words) were coded, representing around an average day of speech to infants. The analysis revealed that for 97% of words, primary stress was carried by the initial syllable, implicating stress as a reliable cue to word onset in German CDS. Word identity was also marked by TPs between syllables, which were higher within than between words, and higher for backwards than forwards transitions. Words followed a Zipfian-like frequency distribution, and over two-thirds of words (78%) were monosyllabic. Of the 50 most frequent words, 82% were function words, which accounted for 47% of word tokens in the entire corpus. Finally, 15% of all utterances comprised single words. These results give rich novel insights into the availability of segmentation cues in German CDS, and support the possibility that infants draw on multiple converging cues to segment their input.

Since surgical patients are already at higher risk of venous thromboembolism than general populations, this study aimed to determine if patients with peri-operative or prior SARS-CoV-2 were at further increased risk of venous thromboembolism. We conducted a planned sub-study and analysis from an international, multicentre, prospective cohort study of elective and emergency patients undergoing surgery during October 2020. Patients from all surgical specialties were included. The primary outcome measure was venous thromboembolism (pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis) within 30\u2009days of surgery. SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis was defined as peri-operative (7\u2009days before to 30\u2009days after surgery); recent (1-6\u2009weeks before surgery); previous (≥7\u2009weeks before surgery); or none. Information on prophylaxis regimens or pre-operative anti-coagulation for baseline comorbidities was not available. Postoperative venous thromboembolism rate was 0.5% (666/123,591) in patients without SARS-CoV-2; 2.2% (50/2317) in patients with peri-operative SARS-CoV-2; 1.6% (15/953) in patients with recent SARS-CoV-2; and 1.0% (11/1148) in patients with previous SARS-CoV-2. After adjustment for confounding factors, patients with peri-operative (adjusted odds ratio 1.5 (95%CI 1.1-2.0)) and recent SARS-CoV-2 (1.9 (95%CI 1.2-3.3)) remained at higher risk of venous thromboembolism, with a borderline finding in previous SARS-CoV-2 (1.7 (95%CI 0.9-3.0)). Overall, venous thromboembolism was independently associated with 30-day mortality (5.4 (95%CI 4.3-6.7)). In patients with SARS-CoV-2, mortality without venous thromboembolism was 7.4% (319/4342) and with venous thromboembolism was 40.8% (31/76).

The primary outcome was postoperative pulmonary complications, adjusted in multivariable models for measured confounders. Pre-defined sub-group analyses were performed for the primary outcome. A total of 96,454 patients from 114 countries were included and overall, 26,948 (27.9%) patients isolated before surgery. Postoperative pulmonary complications were recorded in 1947 (2.0%) patients of which 227 (11.7%) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients who isolated pre-operatively were older, had more respiratory comorbidities and were more commonly from areas of high SARS-CoV-2 incidence and high-income countries.

Two groups of music students (16 piano major students and 19 group/secondary piano students) participated in the study. Piano major students performed a solo work from memory, while group/secondary piano students took a sight-reading exam of an eight-measure piano musical selection. All students performed twice, at baseline and post-EWI, with 2 or 3 days between performances. During the EWI phase, students were randomly divided into two groups: an expressive writing group and a control group. Students in the expressive writing group wrote down feelings and thoughts about their upcoming performances, while students in the control group wrote about a topic unrelated to performing. Each student's pulse was recorded immediately before performing, and each performance was videotaped. Three independent judges evaluated the recordings using a modified version of the Observational Scale for Piano Practicing (OSPP) by Gruson (1988).

Five triads were employed in the task; each composed by a stable 3rd interval (C4-E4) and a varying third note that could generate a 5th (G4), a 6th (A4), a 7th (B4), a 9th (D5), or a 10th (E5) interval. The 10th interval chord was thought to be impossible in actual execution for biomechanical reasons, as long as the thumb and the index finger remained fixed on the 3rd interval. Chords could be listened from loudspeakers, read on a staff, or listened and read at the same time while performing the imagery task. The corticospinal output progressively increased along with task demands in terms of mental representation of hand extension. The effects of audio, visual, or audiovisual musical stimuli were generally similar, unless motor imagery of kinetically impossible triads was required. A specific three-effector motor synergy was detected, governing the representation of the progressive mental extension of the hand. Results demonstrate that corticospinal facilitation in professional piano players can be modulated according to the motor plan, even if simply ""dispatched"" without actual execution.

Currently, integrated machine listening approaches, on the other hand, will mainly recognise only single events. In this context, this contribution aims to provide key insights and approaches, which can be applied in computer audition to achieve the goal of a more holistic intelligent understanding system, as well as identifying challenges in reaching this goal. We firstly summarise the state-of-the-art in traditional signal-processing-based audio pre-processing and feature representation, as well as automated learning such as by deep neural networks. This concerns, in particular, audio interpretation, decomposition, understanding, as well as ontologisation. We then present an agent-based approach for integrating these concepts as a holistic audio understanding system.

Two models of the CT A5 spatial structure are known: the first was obtained by X-ray analysis and the second, by NMR studies in solution. A molecular dynamics (MD) analysis demonstrated that loop II of the toxin has a fixed omega-like shape in water, which does not depend on its initial structure. Interaction of the experimentally derived (X-ray and NMR) conformations and MD-simulated conformations of CT A5 with the lipid bilayer was studied by the Monte Carlo method using the previously developed model of the implicit membrane. The following was found: (1) Unlike the previously studied CT2 from the venom of cobra Naja oxiana, CT A5 has only loops I and II bound to the membrane, with the involvement of a lesser number of hydrophobic residues. (2) A long hydrophobic area is formed on the surface of CT A5 due to the omega-like shape of loop II and the arrangement of loop I in proximity to loop II. This hydrophobic area favors the toxin embedding into the lipid bilayer. (3) The toxin retains its conformation upon interaction with the membrane. (4). The CT A5 molecule has close values of the potential energy in the membrane and in an aqueous environment, which suggests a dynamic character of the binding. The results of the molecular modeling indicate a definite configuration of loops I and II and, consequently, a specific character of distribution of polar and apolar properties on the toxin surface, which turns out to be the most energetically favorable.

NFHS-4 includes data on slums in eight Indian cities, including Delhi, Meerut, Kolkata, Indore, Mumbai, Nagpur, Hyderabad, Chennai. The outcome variables, having fever and cough (FeCo) and diarrhoea in the last two weeks, were used to define the phenotype of infections; for this analysis fever and cough were measures of RTIs and diarrhoea was used to measure GI infections. Exposures considered in this study include variables at the individual, household and slum level and were all informed by existing literature. Multilevel models were used to estimate the association between exposures and outcomes variables; a prior of Cauchy distribution with a scale of 2.5 was selected when building the multilevel logistic models.\nThe total sample size of the number of children included in the analysis was n = 1,424.

Even though under-five orphan children have a higher risk of being underweight, they are the most neglected population.\nThe study aims to determine the prevalence and factors associated with childhood underweight among orphaned preschool children in Southern Ethiopia.\nA community-based analytical cross-sectional study was conducted among 367 orphans. The burden of childhood underweight was assessed using World Health Organization standard cutoff points below -2 SD using z-scores. All variables with a p-value of < 0.25 during binary logistic regression analysis were entered into a multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify predictor variables independently associated with underweight at a p-value of 0.05 with 95% CI.\nIn this study, the prevalence of underweight among orphan children was 27.4%.

We developed a motion-controlled serious game for children that addresses 3 core topics of nutrition, physical activity, and stress coping. It is the first serious game that extensively targets the dietary energy density principle (DED-P) in relation to nutrition. The game is intended to provide an additional educational component for the prevention and treatment of obesity in children.\nThe Kids Obesity Prevention study aimed to evaluate the newly developed game and to evaluate how well children are able to understand and apply the DED-P.\nThis cluster randomized controlled trial collected data from 82 primary school children aged 9 to 12 years and their parents at baseline (T0), at 2 weeks after study commencement (T1), and at the 4-week follow-up (T2). The dropout rate was 3.6%. The intervention group (IG) played the game within 2 weeks (2 sessions with different game modules). One part of the game involves selection of food with the lower energy density when presented with a pair of foods. This allows assessment of whether the children have understood the DED-P and whether they can apply it to unknown foods under time pressure. The control group (CG) received a brochure about the food pyramid concept and physical activity. The primary outcome was the gain in knowledge (nutrition and stress coping) and measured with a pretested questionnaire. The secondary outcomes were the maintenance of knowledge, application of the DED-P, feelings during game play, game acceptance, and behavioral measures (physical activity, media consumption, and dietary intake).\nThe knowledge score ranging from 0 to 100 increased from T0 (IG: 53 [SD 10], CG: 50 [SD 11]) to T1 (IG: 69 [SD 11], CG: 52 [SD 12]) in IG versus CG (P<.001). At T2, the knowledge score of IG remained at the same level as that of T1. Game data showed that after DED-P education, the classification under time pressure of unknown versus known food pairs according to their DED category was similar (hit rate around 70%). Overall, 95% of the children liked the game very much or much.

The current existing artistic style transfer methods cannot generate satisfactory cartoon-style images due to that artistic style images often have delicate strokes and rich hierarchical color changes while cartoon-style images have smooth surfaces without obvious color changes, and sharp edges. To this end, we propose a cartoon loss based generative adversarial network (CartoonLossGAN) for cartoonization. Particularly, we first reuse the encoder part of the discriminator to build a compact generative adversarial network (GAN) based cartoonization architecture. Then we propose a novel cartoon loss function for the architecture. It can imitate the process of sketching to learn the smooth surface of the cartoon image, and imitate the coloring process to learn the coloring of the cartoon image. Furthermore, we also propose an initialization strategy, which is used in the scenario of reusing the discriminator to make our model training easier and more stable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed CartoonLossGAN can generate fantastic cartoon-style images, and outperforms four representative methods.', 'keywords': [], 'journal': 'IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society', 'publication_date': datetime.date(2021, 12, 3), 'authors': [{'lastname': 'Dong', 'firstname': 'Yongsheng', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tan', 'firstname': 'Wei', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tao', 'firstname': 'Dacheng', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zheng', 'firstname': 'Lintao', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Xuelong', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': None}], 'methods': None, 'conclusions': None, 'results': None, 'copyrights': None, 'doi': '10.1109/TIP.2021.3130539', 'xml': <Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x000002BF3C57D360>}, {'pubmed_id': '34614240', 'title': 'Draw a Star and Make it Perfect: Incremental Processing of Telicity.', 'abstract': 'Predicates like ""coloring-the-star"" denote events that have a temporal duration and a culmination point (telos).

While the perfective aspect is known to constrain the conceptualization of the event as telic, many reading studies have demonstrated that readers do not make early commitments as to whether the event is bounded or unbounded. A few visual-world studies tested the processing of telic predicates during online sentence processing, demonstrating an early integration of aspectual and temporal cues. By employing the visual-world paradigm, we tested the incremental processing of the perfective aspect in Italian in two eye-tracking studies in which listeners heard durative predicates in the perfective form in a scenario showing a completed and a non-completed event. Differently from previous studies, we compared telic durative predicates such as ""coloring-the-star"" to punctual predicates such as ""lighting-the-candle."" While for punctual predicates, the inferences of telicity (the event has a telos) and of culmination (the telos is reached) are lexically encoded in the perfective verb, for durative predicates, the degree of event completion (visually encoded) needs to be integrated with perfective aspect (linguistically encoded) for the culmination inference derivation. By modulating the interaction of visual and linguistic stimuli across the two experiments, we show that the verb\'s perfective aspect triggers the culmination inference incrementally during sentence processing, offering novel evidence for the continuous integration of linguistic processing with real-world visual information.', 'keywords': ['Aspect', 'Incremental processing', 'Telicity', 'Visual world paradigm'], 'journal': 'Cognitive science', 'publication_date': datetime.date(2021, 10, 7), 'authors': [{'lastname': 'Foppolo', 'firstname': 'Francesca', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Milan-Bicocca.'}, {'lastname': 'Bosch', 'firstname': 'Jasmijn E', 'initials': 'JE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Milan-Bicocca.'}, {'lastname': 'Greco', 'firstname': 'Ciro', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Coveo AI Labs, Coveo.'}, {'lastname': 'Carminati', 'firstname': 'Maria N', 'initials': 'MN', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Panzeri', 'firstname': 'Francesca', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Milan-Bicocca.'}], 'methods': None, 'conclusions': None, 'results': None, 'copyrights': '© 2021 Cognitive Science Society LLC.', 'doi': '10.1111/cogs.13052', 'xml': <Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x000002BF3C582EA0>}]"

We developed a motion-controlled serious game for children that addresses 3 core topics of nutrition, physical activity, and stress coping. It is the first serious game that extensively targets the dietary energy density principle (DED-P) in relation to nutrition. The game is intended to provide an additional educational component for the prevention and treatment of obesity in children.\nThe Kids Obesity Prevention study aimed to evaluate the newly developed game and to evaluate how well children are able to understand and apply the DED-P.\nThis cluster randomized controlled trial collected data from 82 primary school children aged 9 to 12 years and their parents at baseline (T0), at 2 weeks after study commencement (T1), and at the 4-week follow-up (T2). The dropout rate was 3.6%. The intervention group (IG) played the game within 2 weeks (2 sessions with different game modules). One part of the game involves selection of food with the lower energy density when presented with a pair of foods. This allows assessment of whether the children have understood the DED-P and whether they can apply it to unknown foods under time pressure. The control group (CG) received a brochure about the food pyramid concept and physical activity. The primary outcome was the gain in knowledge (nutrition and stress coping) and measured with a pretested questionnaire. The secondary outcomes were the maintenance of knowledge, application of the DED-P, feelings during game play, game acceptance, and behavioral measures (physical activity, media consumption, and dietary intake).\nThe knowledge score ranging from 0 to 100 increased from T0 (IG: 53 [SD 10], CG: 50 [SD 11]) to T1 (IG: 69 [SD 11], CG: 52 [SD 12]) in IG versus CG (P<.001). At T2, the knowledge score of IG remained at the same level as that of T1. Game data showed that after DED-P education, the classification under time pressure of unknown versus known food pairs according to their DED category was similar (hit rate around 70%). Overall, 95% of the children liked the game very much or much. No group changes were observed at the behavioral level.\nThe Kids Obesity Prevention program sustainably increased knowledge in the areas of nutrition and stress coping, and children were able to apply the DED-P.\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT02551978; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02551978.', 'keywords': ['children', 'energy density', 'nutrition', 'serious game', 'stress'], 'journal': 'Journal of medical Internet research', 'publication_date': datetime.date(2020, 4, 25), 'authors': [{'lastname': 'Mack', 'firstname': 'Isabelle', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Medical Hospital, Tübingen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Reiband', 'firstname': 'Nadine', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Medical Hospital, Tübingen, Germany.\nDepartment of School Psychology, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Etges', 'firstname': 'Carolin', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Medical Hospital, Tübingen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Eichhorn', 'firstname': 'Sabrina', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Medical Hospital, Tübingen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Schaeffeler', 'firstname': 'Norbert', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Medical Hospital, Tübingen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Zurstiege', 'firstname': 'Guido', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Media Studies Tübingen, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Gawrilow', 'firstname': 'Caterina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of School Psychology, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Weimer', 'firstname': 'Katja', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Peeraully', 'firstname': 'Riyad', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': ""Department of Paediatric Surgery, Nottingham Children's Hospital, Nottingham, United Kingdom.""}, {'lastname': 'Teufel', 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'LVR-Clinic for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Blumenstock', 'firstname': 'Gunnar', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Clinical Epidemiology and Applied Biometry, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Giel', 'firstname': 'Katrin Elisabeth', 'initials': 'KE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Medical Hospital, Tübingen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Junne', 'firstname': 'Florian', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Medical Hospital, Tübingen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Zipfel', 'firstname': 'Stephan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, University Medical Hospital, Tübingen, Germany.'}], 'methods': None, 'conclusions': None, 'results': 'The knowledge score ranging from 0 to 100 increased from T0 (IG: 53 [SD 10], CG: 50 [SD 11]) to T1 (IG: 69 [SD 11], CG: 52 [SD 12]) in IG versus CG (P<.001).

Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are emerging as a potential preventive therapy, with multiple protective functions postulated. Our aim is to summarise the evidence concerning the role of HMOs in NEC development and emerging strategies to tailor the delivery of HMOs to preterm infants. Most research efforts to date have focused on supplementing preterm infants with simple oligosaccharides, which are structurally different to HMOs and derived mainly from plants. Clinical trials demonstrate limited benefits for NEC prevention arising from the use of these supplements. Alternative strategies under investigation include optimising HMOs for infants receiving donor human milk, concentrating oligosaccharides from donor human milk and from animal milks, as well as more sophisticated synthetic oligosaccharide production strategies. Critically, high quality evidence to support implementation of any of these approaches in the neonatal unit is lacking. Whether it is a specific HMO alone or a combination of HMOs that exert protective effects remains to be elucidated. Further challenges include how best to manufacture and administer oligosaccharides whilst retaining bioactivity and safety, including evaluation of the long-term effects of altering the balance of HMOs and gut microbiota in preterm infants. While several human clinical trials are underway, further research is needed to understand whether a tailored approach to oligosaccharide supplementation is beneficial for preterm infants.', 'keywords': ['breast milk', 'necrotising enterocolitis', 'neonatal nutrition', 'oligosaccharides', 'preterm (birth)', 'very low birth weight infants'], 'journal': 'Frontiers in nutrition', 'publication_date': datetime.date(2021, 8, 17), 'authors': [{'lastname': 'Abbas', 'firstname': 'Safiyyah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Women's and Children's Health Network, Adelaide, SA, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Keir', 'firstname': 'Amy K', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': ""Women's and Children's Health Network, Adelaide, SA, Australia.\nSAHMRI Women and Kids, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia.\nAdelaide Medical School, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.\nRobinson Research Institute, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Makrides', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'SAHMRI Women and Kids, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia.\nRobinson Research Institute, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Klein', 'firstname': 'Laura D', 'initials': 'LD', 'affiliation': 'Business Growth and Innovation, Australian Red Cross Lifeblood, Sydney, NSW, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Grzeskowiak', 'firstname': 'Luke E', 'initials': 'LE', 'affiliation': 'SAHMRI Women and Kids, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia.\nCollege of Medicine and Public Health, Flinders University, Adelaide, SA, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'McPhee', 'firstname': 'Andrew J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'SAHMRI Women and Kids, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Rumbold', 'firstname': 'Alice R', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': 'SAHMRI Women and Kids, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia.\nAdelaide Medical School, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.\nRobinson Research Institute, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.'}], 'methods': None, 'conclusions': None, 'results': None, 'copyrights': 'Copyright © 2021 Abbas, Keir, Makrides, Klein, Grzeskowiak, McPhee and Rumbold.', 'doi': '10.3389/fnut.2021.702888', 'xml': <Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x000002BF3C61DE00>}]"

The neural substrate of the ability of using the WCI for the complex syntactic hierarchical structure processing, however, is yet unknown. Therefore, we directly conducted an fMRI experiment by using a pseudo-Chinese artificial language with syntactic structures containing a center-embedded relative clause. Thirty non-Chinese native (Korean) speakers were randomly divided into two groups: one acquired WCI and WCI-based syntactic rules (the WCI group) before the scanning session, and the other did not (the non-WCI group). Both groups were required to judge the grammaticality of the testing sentences, with critical long-distance dependencies between two elements (the main verb and the relativizer). Behaviorally, the WCI group\'s accuracy was significantly higher and its reaction time was shorter. The scanning results showed that the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) and Broca\'s area were more strongly activated for the WCI group, and the dynamic causal modeling analyses revealed a distinct effective connectivity pattern for this group. Therefore, the present research, for the first time, reveals that the activation of and the functional connectivity between Broca\'s area and the left STG play a critical role in the ability of the rule-based use of the WCI which is crucial for complex hierarchical structure building, and might be substantially corresponding to the ""labeling competence"" within the linguistic framework.', 'keywords': ['artificial grammar', 'complex hierarchical syntactic structure', 'dynamic causal modeling', 'fMRI', 'labeling competence', 'rule-based', 'word category information'], 'journal': 'Human brain mapping', 'publication_date': datetime.date(2018, 9, 22), 'authors': [{'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Luyao', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'College of Chinese Language and Culture, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.\nDepartment of Neuropsychology, Max Plank Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Junjie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Fu', 'firstname': 'Yongben', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Kang', 'firstname': 'Huntae', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'College of Chinese Language and Culture, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Feng', 'firstname': 'Liping', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'College of Chinese Language and Culture, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.'}], 'methods': None, 'conclusions': None, 'results': None, 'copyrights': '© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.', 'doi': '10.1002/hbm.24386', 'xml': <Element 'PubmedArticle' at 0x000002BF3C60E040>}, {'pubmed_id': '28744901\n15509387\n19648456\n25644408\n11773629\n12546489\n18838016\n17662975\n15925574\n10782103\n25810896\n10025555\n22985438\n11376642\n23163772\n15147495\n14686083\n11523274\n23968150\n7929878\n2797413\n24403724\n1786672\n18315796\n18657314\n19854436\n22003842\n23548434\n23972155\n3782452\n6501465\n3401382\n25307166\n17870040\n15772969\n16637761\n12030471\n11009247\n2920538\n21413938\n24956024\n15195094\n8403835', 'title': 'Input and Age-Dependent Variation in Second Language Learning: A Connectionist Account.', 'abstract': ""Language learning requires linguistic input, but several studies have found that knowledge of second language (L2) rules does not seem to improve with more language exposure (e.g., Johnson & Newport, 1989). One reason for this is that previous studies did not factor out variation due to the different rules tested. To examine this issue, we reanalyzed grammaticality judgment scores in Flege, Yeni-Komshian, and Liu's (1999) study of L2 learners using rule-related predictors and found that, in addition to the overall drop in performance due to a sensitive period, L2 knowledge increased with years of input. Knowledge of different grammar rules was negatively associated with input frequency of those rules. To better understand these effects, we modeled the results using a connectionist model that was trained using Korean as a first language (L1) and then English as an L2. To explain the sensitive period in L2 learning, the model's learning rate was reduced in an age-related manner. By assigning different learning rates for syntax and lexical learning, we were able to model the difference between early and late L2 learners in input sensitivity. The model's learning mechanism allowed transfer between the L1 and L2, and this helped to explain the differences between different rules in the grammaticality judgment task. This work demonstrates that an L1 model of learning and processing can be adapted to provide an explicit account of how the input and the sensitive period interact in L2 learning."", 'keywords': ['Age of acquisition', 'Connectionist neural network', 'Input-based learning', 'Language acquisition', 'Second language learning', 'Sensitive period'], 'journal': 'Cognitive science', 'publication_date': datetime.date(2017, 7, 27), 'authors': [{'lastname': 'Janciauskas', 'firstname': 'Marius', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, The University of Liverpool.'}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Franklin', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, The University of Liverpool.'}], 'methods': None, 'conclusions': None, 'results': None, 'copyrights': 'Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

We developed a motion-controlled serious game for children that addresses 3 core topics of nutrition, physical activity, and stress coping. It is the first serious game that extensively targets the dietary energy density principle (DED-P) in relation to nutrition. The game is intended to provide an additional educational component for the prevention and treatment of obesity in children.\nThe Kids Obesity Prevention study aimed to evaluate the newly developed game and to evaluate how well children are able to understand and apply the DED-P.\nThis cluster randomized controlled trial collected data from 82 primary school children aged 9 to 12 years and their parents at baseline (T0), at 2 weeks after study commencement (T1), and at the 4-week follow-up (T2). The dropout rate was 3.6%. The intervention group (IG) played the game within 2 weeks (2 sessions with different game modules). One part of the game involves selection of food with the lower energy density when presented with a pair of foods. This allows assessment of whether the children have understood the DED-P and whether they can apply it to unknown foods under time pressure. The control group (CG) received a brochure about the food pyramid concept and physical activity. The primary outcome was the gain in knowledge (nutrition and stress coping) and measured with a pretested questionnaire. The secondary outcomes were the maintenance of knowledge, application of the DED-P, feelings during game play, game acceptance, and behavioral measures (physical activity, media consumption, and dietary intake).\nThe knowledge score ranging from 0 to 100 increased from T0 (IG: 53 [SD 10], CG: 50 [SD 11]) to T1 (IG: 69 [SD 11], CG: 52 [SD 12]) in IG versus CG (P<.001). At T2, the knowledge score of IG remained at the same level as that of T1.

It is difficult to reduce salt in such settings. Our previous study (School-based Education programme to reduce Salt(School-EduSalt)) demonstrated that educating schoolchildren, who then instructed their families to reduce the amount of salt used at home, is effective in lowering salt intake in both children and adults. Our team also developed an app called 'KnowSalt', which could help individuals to estimate their salt intake and the major sources of salt in the diet. Building on School-EduSalt and KnowSalt, we propose to develop a new app (AppSalt) focusing on salt reduction through education, target setting, monitoring, evaluation, decision support and management to achieve a progressive lower salt intake for long term. To evaluate the effectiveness of the AppSalt programme, we will carry out a cluster randomised controlled trial.\nWe will recruit 54 primary schools from urban and rural areas of three provinces in China. A total of 594 children aged 8-9 years and 1188 adult family members will be randomly selected for evaluation. After baseline assessment, schools will be randomly allocated to either the intervention or control group. Children in the intervention group will be taught, with support of AppSalt, about salt reduction and assigned homework to get the whole family involved in the activities to reduce salt consumption. The duration of the intervention is two school terms (ie, 1\u2009year). The primary outcome is the difference between the intervention and control group in the change of salt intake as measured by 24-hour urinary sodium.\nThe study has been approved by Queen Mary Research Ethics Committee and Peking University Health Science Centre IRB.

While the authors raise important considerations, such as accounting for the extent of linkage disequilibrium in a study system, we strongly disagree with their overall view of the ability of RADseq to inform our understanding of the genetic basis of adaptation. The family of RADseq protocols has radically improved the field of population genomics, expanding by several orders of magnitude the number of markers available while substantially reducing the cost per marker. Researchers whose goal is to identify regions of the genome under selection must consider the LD of the experimental system; however, there is no magical LD cutoff below which researchers should refuse to use RADseq. Lowry et\xa0al. further made two major arguments: a theoretical argument that modeled the likelihood of detecting selective sweeps with RAD markers, and gross summaries based on an anecdotal collection of RAD studies. Unfortunately, their simulations were off by two orders of magnitude in the worst case, while their anecdotes merely showed that it is possible to get widely divergent densities of RAD tags for any particular experiment, either by design or due to experimental efficacy. We strongly argue that RADseq remains a powerful and efficient approach that provides sufficient marker density for studying selection in many natural populations.

These disabilities are due to the neurological disorders which affects brain functions. Early diagnosis of these disabilities in kids from age 3 to 6 will help to start early medical treatments and get them back to the normal condition.\nwe developed a software-based Learning Disability Evaluation Kit called YALU with computer Game Modules for kids targeting their learning disabilities. These Computer game-based modules of the YALU consist of different tasks for the different age levels to identify the symptoms of the disabilities mentioned above. The children's interaction results to each task of the game modules with the answers of the questioner about the children given by the parents will be evaluated with the threshold values given by a panel of consultant psychologist and paediatrician of the normal kids to identify the learning disabilities in kids aged 3-6\u2009years. The result will be given to the respective parties and uploaded to the Website under the child's name.\nYALU has been tested using 50 students in age 3-5 in three preschools. The teachers have identified Fourteen students with some learning disability symptoms. Using YALU, twelve out of fourteen students had been clearly identified. Hence, the YALU Evaluation Kit to have an accuracy 85% in diagnosing the right disability. However, the accuracy could be increased with the accurate assessments of the parents about their kids.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONLearning disabilities are neurological disorders that affect the brain's ability to receive, process, store, respond to and communicate information; and there are four types (Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Dysgraphia and Dyscalculia)In this paper, we present the extracted computational techniques targeting the Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Dysgraphia and Dyscalculia and developed a software application (YALU Learning Disability Evaluation Kit) which consists of computer game modules for the kids for evaluation their learning disabilities.The developed game modules can screen the learning disabilities and these gamification modules (YALU) consists of tasks which are based on symptoms of the said disabilities.

Thus, given the historically poor survival of hematopoietic cell transplantation patients using extracorporeal life support, the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigators' hematopoietic cell transplantation and cancer immunotherapy subgroup aimed to characterize the utility of extracorporeal life support in facilitating recovery from critical cardiorespiratory illnesses in pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation patients.\nAll available published data were identified using a set of PubMed search terms for pediatric extracorporeal life support and hematopoietic cell transplantation.\nAll articles that provided original reports of pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation patients who underwent extracorporeal life support were included. Sixty-four manuscripts met search criteria. Twenty-four were included as primary reports of pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation patients who underwent extracorporeal life support (11 were single case reports, four single institution case series, two multi-institution case series, and seven registry reports from Extracorporeal Life Support Organization, Pediatric Heath Information System, and Virtual Pediatric Systems).\nAll 24 articles were reviewed by first and last authors and a spread sheet was constructed including sample size, potential biases, and conclusions.\nDiscussions regarding incorporation of available evidence into our clinical practice were held at biannual meetings, as well as through email and virtual meetings. An expert consensus was determined through these discussions and confirmed through a modified Delphi process.\nExtracorporeal life support in hematopoietic cell transplantation patients is being used with increasing frequency and potentially improving survival. The Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigators hematopoietic cell transplantation-cancer immunotherapy subgroup has developed a framework to guide physicians in decision-making surrounding extracorporeal life support candidacy in pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation patients. In addition to standard extracorporeal life support considerations, candidacy in the hematopoietic cell transplantation population should consider the following six factors in order of consensus agreement: 1) patient comorbidities; 2) underlying disease necessitating hematopoietic cell transplantation; 3) hematopoietic cell transplantation toxicities, 4) family and patient desires for goals of care; 5) hematopoietic cell transplantation preparatory regimen; and 6) graft characteristics. Although risk assessment may be individualized, data are currently insufficient to clearly delineate ideal candidacy. Therefore, we urge the onco-critical care community to collaborate and capture data to provide better evidence to guide physicians' decision-making in the future."", 'keywords': [], 'journal': 'Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies', 'publication_date': datetime.date(2021, 12, 9), 'authors': [{'lastname': 'Zinter', 'firstname': 'Matt S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.

The aim of this study was to examine prevalence and determinants of receipt of provider recommendation for influenza vaccination as well as influenza vaccination uptake during pregnancy.\nWe analysed data from the ""KUNO Kids Health Study"", a prospective birth cohort. During the study period (5th July 2015 to 27th June 2018) data were collected from participating mothers by interview and questionnaire. According to Andersen\'s behavioural model of health services use potential influencing factors describing the circumstances and characteristics of the mothers and their pregnancies which are potentially affecting whether women receive a recommendation for a vaccination or whether they utilize influenza vaccination were classified into three domains: \'predisposing characteristics\', \'enabling resources\' and \'need\'. Using multivariable logistic regression models odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated.\nAs a combined result across three flu seasons, 368 of 1814 (20.3%) women received an influenza vaccination recommendation during pregnancy. Having had a high-risk pregnancy increased the odds of receiving a vaccination recommendation (OR\u2009=\u20091.3; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.0-1.6; p\u2009=\u20090.045).

Two hundred forty-two of one thousand eight hundred sixty-five (13%) women were vaccinated against influenza during pregnancy.

Varela's neurophenomenological research program (NRP) aspires to bridge the gap between, and integrate, first-person (1P) and third-person (3P) approaches to understanding the mind. It does so by suggesting a methodological framework allowing these two irreducible phenomenal domains to relate and reciprocally support the investigation of one another. While highly appealing theoretically, neurophenomenology invites researchers to a challenging methodological endeavor. Based on our experience with empirical neurophenomenological implementation, we offer practical clarifications and insights learnt along the way. In the first part of the paper, we outline the theoretical principles of the NRP and briefly present the field of 1P research. We speak to the importance of phenomenological training and outline the utility of cooperating with meditators as skilled participants. We suggest that 1P accounts of subjective experience can be placed on a complexity continuum ranging between thick and thin phenomenology, highlighting the tension and trade-off inherent to the neurophenomenological attempt to naturalize phenomenology. We then outline a typology of bridges, which create mutual constraints between 1P and 3P approaches, and argue for the utility of alternating between the bridges depending on the available experimental resources, domain of interest and level of sought articulation. In the second part of the paper, we demonstrate how the theory can be put into practice by describing a decade of neurophenomenological studies investigating the sense of self with increasing focus on its embodied, and minimal, aspects. These aspects are accessed via the dissolution of the sense-of-boundaries, shedding new light on the multi-dimensionality and flexibility of embodied selfhood. We emphasize the evolving neurophenomenological dialogue, showing how consecutive studies, placed differently on the thin-to-thick 1P continuum, advance the research project by using the bridging principles appropriate for each stage."", 'keywords': ['embodied self', 'magnetoencephalography (MEG)', 'meditation', 'neurophenomenology', 'self boundaries', 'sense of self'], 'journal': 'Frontiers in psychology', 'publication_date': datetime.date(2020, 8, 15), 'authors': [{'lastname': 'Berkovich-Ohana', 'firstname': 'Aviva', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Learning, Instruction and Teacher Education, Faculty of Education, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel.\nDepartment of Counseling and Human Development, Faculty of Education, University of Haifa, Haifa, Israel.\nEdmond J.

Given that the format of medical education is not fixed, but malleable and in fact must be adaptable to societal needs through ongoing reflexivity, we find ourselves in a potentially transformative learning phase for the field. An Association for Medical Education in Europe ASPIRE Academy group of 18 medical educators from seven countries was formed to consider this opportunity, and identified critical questions for collective reflection on current medical education practices and assumptions, with the attendant challenge to envision the future of medical education. This was achieved through online discussion as well as asynchronous collective reflections by group members. Four major themes and related conclusions arose from this conversation: Why we teach: the humanitarian mission of medicine should be reinforced; what we teach: disaster management, social accountability and embracing an environment of complexity and uncertainty should be the core; how we teach: open pathways to lean medical education and learning by developing learners embedded in a community context; and whom we teach: those willing to take professional responsibility.

At a time where opportunities for face-to-face engagement are limited, the ability to interact,\xa0learn\xa0and generate actionable insights through digital channels such as Twitter, is of considerable value.\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate digital engagement among global diabetes mellitus researchers.\nWe identified every global tweet (20,614,515) and scientific publication (44,135) regarding diabetes mellitus from 1 August 2018 to 1 August 2020. Through author matching we combined datasets, resulting in a list of digitally active scientific authors. Generalised linear modelling identified factors predicting their digital engagement.\nGlobally, 2686 diabetes researchers used Twitter to discuss the management of diabetes mellitus, posting 110,346 diabetes-related tweets. As Twitter followers increased, so did tweet frequency (p\xa0<\xa00.001), retweets (p\xa0<\xa00.001) and replies (p\xa0<\xa00.001) to their content. Publication count (overall/per month) and proportion of first/last authorships were unrelated to tweet frequency and the likelihood of being retweeted or replied to (p\xa0>\xa00.05). Those with the most \xa0academic\xa0co-authors were significantly less likely to tweet than those with smaller networks (<\xa050; p\xa0=\xa00.001). Finally, those publishing most frequently on specific themes, including insulin (p\xa0=\xa00.041) and paediatrics (p\xa0<\xa00.001), were significantly more likely to tweet about these themes.\nAcademic expertise and seniority cannot be assumed as proxies for digital influence. Those aiming to promote science and obtain digital insights regarding condition management should consider looking beyond well-known 'key opinion leaders' to perhaps lesser known 'digital opinion leaders' with smaller academic networks, who are likely to specialise in the delivery of highly specific content to captive audiences.\nTraditionally, research scientists and clinical experts in any field make their opinions and expertise known by writing academic journal papers. After successful peer review, they are accepted and made publicly available. However, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, more scientific information has been shared and discussed using digital platforms such as Twitter than ever before, setting the stage for their greater role in scientific discussions in the future. It is important that the pharmaceutical industry is aware of this shift as it may offer up new insights and opportunities. Using diabetes as a test case, we compared researchers’ publishing activity with their Twitter activity over a 2-year period. We found that less established researchers who are less well-known in their fields, and with less publications to their name, are far more likely to be active in sharing valuable scientific content to large Twitter audiences. This makes them ‘opinion leaders’ even if they would not be thought of as such in a traditional, academic sense, suggesting that those who look only to high-ranking academic journals, and those who publish within them, may be missing an important and ever-increasing part of the conversation. This is the first ever study to compare digital and traditional publishing activities and highlights the potential of this approach to gain novel and valuable knowledge about specific topics."", 'keywords': [], 'journal': 'Pharmaceutical medicine', 'publication_date': datetime.date(2021, 12, 8), 'authors': [{'lastname': 'Leigh', 'firstname': 'Simon', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'VISFO, Mill Royd St., HD6 1EY, Brighouse, UK. simon@visfo.health.\nInstitute of Digital Healthcare, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK. simon@visfo.health.'}, {'lastname': 'Noble', 'firstname': 'Max E', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': 'VISFO, Mill Royd St., HD6 1EY, Brighouse, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Pearson', 'firstname': 'Frances E', 'initials': 'FE', 'affiliation': 'VISFO, Mill Royd St., HD6 1EY, Brighouse, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Iremonger', 'firstname': 'James', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'VISFO, Mill Royd St., HD6 1EY, Brighouse, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Williams', 'firstname': 'David T', 'initials': 'DT', 'affiliation': 'VISFO, Mill Royd St., HD6 1EY, Brighouse, UK.'}], 'methods': None, 'conclusions': ""Academic expertise and seniority cannot be assumed as proxies for digital influence.

We assessed the quality of referee interactions with children during sports competitions in soccer. Based on the developmental theory and research suggesting that interactions between kids and adults are the primary mechanism of their development and learning, we focused on the quality of the referee-player interactions in terms of (1) emotional support, (2) game organization, and (3) instructional support. Twenty-five soccer referees who refereed matches for children aged 9-12 years were recruited. The Referee Educational Function Assessment Scoring System (REFASS) was used to assess the quality of the referee-player interactions. This tool was developed based on Classroom Assessment Scoring System-Upper Elementary. Regarding the REFASS dimensions, the mean scores for positive climate, Sensitivity, behavior management, content understanding and quality of feedback were in the medium range, while productivity and negative climate in the high range. In the case of the positive climate variable, the lowest mean ratings were recorded compared to other assessed dimensions. The assessments of the quality of referee-player interactions obtained for particular dimensions translated into the ratings for the specified domains. The highest ratings were given to game organization (6.0 ± 0.8; Me = 6.0), whereas the emotional support and instructional support were in the medium range (4.6 ± 1.5; Me = 4.5, and 5.2 ± 1.8; Me = 6.0, respectively). Referees are usually not aware of their pedagogical function and the complexity of their respective responsibilities. They are commonly considered to be ordinary technicians and evaluators of performance in competition. Based on the results, a postulate was formulated that referees should consciously perform a pedagogical function in the youth sport. Therefore, it is necessary to train them in educational methods and techniques appropriate to the age and needs of the child.

The design of locally acceptable strategies requires an in-depth understanding of the household context. In this formative research study, we aimed to characterize the home play and learning environments of children 6-23\u2009months of age from low-income households in peri-urban Lima, Peru.\nDrawing on the developmental niche framework, we used quantitative and qualitative methods to understand children's physical and social settings, childcare practices, and caregiver perspectives. We conducted interviews, unstructured video-recorded observations, and spot-checks with 30 randomly selected caregiver-child dyads, 10 from each child age group of 6-11, 12-17, and 18-23\u2009months of age, as well as key informant interviews with 12 daycare instructors. We analyzed the data for key trends and themes using Stata and ATLAS.ti and employed an adapted version of the Indicator of Parent-Child Interaction to evaluate the observations.\nChildren's social settings were characterized by multi-generational homes and the presence of siblings and cousins as play partners. Access to books and complex hand-eye coordination toys (e.g., puzzles, building blocks) in the home was limited (30.0 and 40.0%, respectively). Caregivers generally demonstrated low or inconsistent levels of interaction with their children; they rarely communicated using descriptive language or introduced novel, stimulating activities during play. Reading and telling stories to children were uncommon, yet 93.3% of caregivers reported singing to children daily. On average, caregivers ascribed a high learning value to reading books and playing with electronic toys (rated 9.7 and 9.1 out of 10, respectively), and perceived playing with everyday objects in the home as less beneficial (rated 6.8/10). Daycare instructors reinforced the problems posed by limited caregiver-child interaction and supported the use of songs for promoting ECD.\nThe features of the home learning environments highlighted here indicate several opportunities for intervention development to improve ECD. These include encouraging caregivers to communicate with children using full sentences and enhancing the use of everyday objects as toys.

Out of these articles, similar indicators were aggregated to result in a total of 32 welfare indicators, some of which were covered in multiple articles, others in only a single one. We discuss a set of three established assessment protocols containing these indicators, as well as all individual indicators which were covered in more than one article. As single indicators, we identified lameness, body condition score (BCS), qualitative behaviour assessment (QBA), and human-animal relationship (HAR) tests with substantial evidence for sufficient validity to assess welfare in goats. A multitude of indicators (e.g., hair coat condition) was studied less intensively but was successfully used for welfare assessments. For some indicators (e.g., oblivion, lying behaviour), we highlight the need for future research to further validate them or to optimise their use in on-farm welfare assessments.

We examined whether age-correction procedures could be used to better identify individuals at very early potential risk from adults who did not have any existing cognitive diagnosis. First, we obtained cross-sectional age effects for each structural feature using data from a selected portion of the Human Connectome Project Aging (HCP-A) cohort. After age detrending, we weighted AD structural deterioration with patterns quantified from data of the Alzheimer\'s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Support vector machine was then used to classify individuals with brains that most resembled atrophy in AD across the entire HCP-A sample. Additionally, we iteratively adjusted the pipeline by removing individuals classified as AD-like from the HCP-A cohort to minimize atypical brain structural contributions to the age detrending. The classifier had a mean cross-validation accuracy of 94.0% for AD recognition. It also could identify mild cognitive impairment with more severe AD-specific biomarkers and worse cognition. In an independent HCP-A cohort, 8.8% were identified as AD-like, and they trended toward worse cognition. An ""AD risk"" score derived from the machine learning models also significantly correlated with cognition. This work provides a proof of concept for the potential to use structural brain imaging to identify asymptomatic individuals at young ages who show structural brain patterns similar to AD and are potentially at risk for a future clinical disorder.', 'keywords': [""Alzheimer's disease"", 'aging', 'classifier', 'machine learning'], 'journal': 'Human brain mapping', 'publication_date': datetime.date(2021, 9, 29), 'authors': [{'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Binyin', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Institute of Neurology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.\nMGH/MIT/HMS Athinoula A.

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Commercially-Available Brain Training Programs in Healthy and Cognitively Impaired Older Adults.', 'abstract': 'The rising prevalence rates of age-related cognitive impairment are a worldwide public concern, bringing about a surge in the number of ""brain training"" programs commercially available to the general public. Numerous companies advertise that their products improve memory and protect against cognitive decline, though researchers have voiced concerns regarding the validity of such claims. To address this issue, the current meta-analytic investigation examined evidence from 43 studies (encompassing 2,636 participants) to evaluate the efficacy of commercial training programs within two separate populations: healthy older adults and older adults with mild cognitive-impairment (MCI). Seven programs were identified: BrainGymmer, BrainHQ, CogMed, CogniFit, Dakim, Lumosity, and MyBrainTrainer. Analyses yielded small, significant near-transfer effects for both healthy and MCI samples. Far-transfer was not observed for the MCI sample, whereas a small, significant effect was found for subjective but not objective measures of far-transfer in the healthy sample. Analyses of individual domains (combining near-and far-transfer outcomes) yielded significant transfer to executive-functioning, memory, and processing-speed in healthy older adults. After adjusting for publication bias, only the effect size for processing speed remained significant. Transfer to attention, objective everyday functioning, fluid-intelligence, and visuospatial domains was not significant. Thus, whilst ""brain training"" may be suitable for enjoyment and entertainment purposes, there is currently insufficient empirical evidence to support that such training can improve memory, general cognition, or everyday functioning.

Forty-five students were chosen from nine classes in grades 2, 4, and 6 of a central elementary school in Beijing City using experimental research, and the experimental group and the control group were set up. A questionnaire was adopted to conduct the pre-test and post-test of the experiment, which were done to analyze the factors that affect the attitude of students toward music learning and the effect of piano teaching. The results show that the encouragement level of the piano teacher and the enthusiasm of the students in the piano course were significantly correlated at the 0.01 level. There was also a significant correlation between self-efficacy and student piano learning enthusiasm at the 0.01 level. Furthermore, the pre-test and post-test results showed that the students in the experimental group of each grade generally performed much better in piano learning than the students in the control group, which proves that the ""Pygmalion effect"" can play an excellent interventional role in piano teaching. In this research, the value of ""Pygmalion effect"" in the educational psychology of piano music education in primary schools was deeply studied to explore the possibility of a novel piano teaching model. The research results show that teacher encouragement can stimulate the subjective initiative of students and make them perform better in piano learning.

This is evident when pianists exhibit activity in motor and premotor cortices, as part of a dorsal pathway, while listening to a familiar piece of music, or when naïve participants learn to play simple patterns on the piano. Here we investigated the interaction between multimodal learning and dorsal-stream activity over the course of four weeks in ten skilled pianists by adopting a naturalistic data-driven analysis approach. We presented the pianists with audio-only, video-only and audiovisual recordings of a piano sonata during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after they had learned to play the sonata by heart for a total of four weeks. We followed the learning process and its outcome with questionnaires administered to the pianists, one piano instructor following their training, and seven external expert judges. The similarity of the pianists' brain activity during stimulus presentations was examined before and after learning by means of inter-subject correlation (ISC) analysis. After learning, an increased ISC was found in the pianists while watching the audiovisual performance, particularly in motor and premotor regions of the dorsal stream. While these brain structures have previously been associated with learning simple audio-motor sequences, our findings are the first to suggest their involvement in learning a complex and demanding audiovisual-motor task. Moreover, the most motivated learners and the best performers of the sonata showed ISC in the dorsal stream and in the reward brain network."", 'keywords': ['audiovisual perception', 'auditory-motor integration', 'dorsal pathway', 'motivation', 'multimodal learning', 'striatum'], 'journal': 'Neuroscience', 'publication_date': datetime.date(2020, 6, 23), 'authors': [{'lastname': 'Fasano', 'firstname': 'Maria C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology and Behavioural Sciences, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Glerean', 'firstname': 'Enrico', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland; International Laboratory of Social Neurobiology, Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, National Research University Higher School of Economics, Moscow, Russia.'}, {'lastname': 'Gold', 'firstname': 'Benjamin P', 'initials': 'BP', 'affiliation': 'Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreál, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Sheng', 'firstname': 'Dana', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sams', 'firstname': 'Mikko', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience and Biomedical Engineering, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland; Department of Computer Science, Alto University, Espoo, Finland; Advanced Magnetic Imaging (AMI) Centre, Aalto University School of Science, Espoo, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Vuust', 'firstname': 'Peter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Center for Music in the Brain (MIB), Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University & The Royal Academy of Music Aarhus/Aalborg, Aarhus, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Rauschecker', 'firstname': 'Josef P', 'initials': 'JP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neuroscience, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, USA; Institute for Advanced Study, TUM, Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Brattico', 'firstname': 'Elvira', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Center for Music in the Brain (MIB), Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University & The Royal Academy of Music Aarhus/Aalborg, Aarhus, Denmark; Department of Education, Psychology, Communication, University of Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy.
