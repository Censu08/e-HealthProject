Baby Panda World,32712376,Feasibility and effectiveness of teleconsultation in children with epilepsy amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in a resource-limited country.,"['Antiepileptic drugs', 'COVID-19', 'Child neurology', 'Epilepsy', 'Teleconsultation']",Seizure,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures employed by the government have forced neurologists across the world to look upon telemedicine as the only feasible and practical option to continue providing health care towards children with epilepsy in home isolation. Children with epilepsy are challenging for teleconsultation as direct information from the patient is missing, regarding seizures and adverse effects, especially behavioral and psychological side effects.
Clinical and epilepsy-related details of telephonic consultations for children 1 month-18 years, performed between 26th March and 17th May 2020 in a tertiary care teaching hospital in Uttarakhand (a state of India known for hilly terrains with low per capita income) were recorded. Suitable changes in the dose/commercial brand of antiepileptic drug (AED) regimen were performed, along with the addition of new AED and referral to local practitioners for immediate hospitalization, when urgent health care issues were detected. Voice call, text message, picture/video message, and all other possible measures were employed to accumulate maximum clinical information in real-time.
A total of 153 children(95 males [62 %], 9.45 ± 3.24 years, 140 lower/middle socioeconomic status) were enrolled after screening 237 children with various neurological disorders, whose caregivers contacted for teleconsultation. A total of 278 telephone consultations performed for these 153 children (1-5 telephone calls per patient). Hundred-thirteen children were identified to have a total of 152 significant clinical events (breakthrough seizure/uncontrolled epilepsy (108), AED related (13), and unrelated systemic adverse effects (24), worsening of associated co-morbidities (7). In rest of the patients, the query of the caregiver included unavailability of AED/prescribed commercial brand in the locality, query related to the dose of drugs, proxy for a scheduled routine visit (no active issues), and concern regarding COVID-19 related symptoms and effect of COVID-19 and lockdown in children with epilepsy. Ninety-three (60 %) patients required hiking up of AED dose, whereas 29 (17 %) patients required the addition of a new AED/commercial brand. Five children were advised immediate admission to a nearby hospital. Overall, 147 (96 %) caregivers were satisfied with the quality of medical advice.

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) formulated and established laboratory surveillance for COVID-19. In this study, an analysis of the surveillance data was done to describe the testing performance and descriptive epidemiology of COVID-19 cases by time, place and person.
The data were extracted from January 22 to April 30, 2020. The frequencies of testing performance were described over time and by place. We described cases by time (epidemic curve by date of specimen collection; seven-day moving average), place (area map) and person (attack rate by age, sex and contact status), and trends were represented along with public health measures and events.
Between January 22 and April 30, 2020, a total of 1,021,518 individuals were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Testing increased from about 250 individuals per day in the beginning of March to 50,000 specimens per day by the end of April 2020. Overall, 40,184 (3.9%) tests were reported positive. The proportion of positive cases was highest among symptomatic and asymptomatic contacts, 2-3-fold higher than among those with severe acute respiratory infection, or those with an international travel history or healthcare workers. The attack rate (per million) by age was highest among those aged 50-69 yr (63.3) and was lowest among those under 10 yr (6.1). The attack rate was higher among males (41.6) than females (24.3). The secondary attack rate was 6.0 per cent. Overall, 99.0 per cent of 736 districts reported testing and 71.1 per cent reported COVID-19 cases.
The coverage and frequency of ICMR's laboratory surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 improved over time. COVID-19 was reported from most parts of India, and the attack rate was more among men and the elderly and common among close contacts. Analysis of the data indicates that for further insight, additional surveillance tools and strategies at the national and sub-national levels are needed.",,,,,10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_1896_20,2020-07-03,"[{'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': '1 Human Influenza Group, † ICMR-National Institute of Virology, Pune, Maharashtra, 2 Division of Epidemiology & Communicable Diseases, 3 Informatics, Systems & Research Management Cell, 4 Department of Health Research, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Indian Council of Medical Research, 5Independent Public Health Specialist, 6 WHO Country Office for India, 7 Indian Institute of Public Health-Bengaluru, Public Health Foundation of India, New Delhi, 8 ICMR School of Public Health, 9 Division of Online Courses, 10 Division of Epidemiology & Bio-Statistics, †† ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, 11 Independent Consultant, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh & 12 Jan Swasthya Sahyog, Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, India.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",10

Fostering family planning practice alleviates poverty, accelerates socioeconomic development, increases child schooling, promotes gender equality, and decreases maternal and infant mortality. The study objective was to find out the perception of potential users, health workers, and health professionals on the reasons for nonusage of contraceptive services provided and to recognize possible solutions to the identified barriers.
This cross-sectional study was done using qualitative methods among three groups of people by focus group discussion and in-depth interviews. The study was conducted in the rural health center of Madanpur Khaddar, Department of Community Medicine, Jamia Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, from June to August 2016.
The median age group of the participants was 27 years, and the participants were majorily less educated and were homemakers. Description of key thematic issues found out that contraceptive nonusage was due to lack of accessibility, lack of availability, as well as issues with privacy and autonomy. Out of 25 women, 3 had never heard the term Copper-T (CuT). Twelve out of the rest 22 women had heard about CuT, but knew no more than that.
The findings that have emerged from this study thus provide some recommendations to increase the demand for contraception. Effective information, education, and communication should be promoted continuously with the help of community health workers for better acceptance of CuT because it is believed that no single child should be born into the world unplanned.",,,,,10.4103/nmj.NMJ_9_17,2019-07-16,"[{'lastname': 'Panda', 'firstname': 'Meely', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Community Medicine, HIMSR, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Pathak', 'firstname': 'Rambha', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Community Medicine, HIMSR, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Rasheed', 'firstname': 'Nazish', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Community Medicine, Lady Hardinge Medical College, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Shaikh', 'firstname': 'Zakirhusain', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Department of Community Medicine, HIMSR, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Islam', 'firstname': 'Farzana', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Community Medicine, HIMSR, Jamia Hamdard, New Delhi, India.'}]",10

The Sixth Biennial Pediatric Anesthesia Neurodevelopment Assessment (PANDA) symposium at Columbia University included a moderated poster presentation session where 4 investigators presented their latest contributions to the landscape of clinical anesthetic neurotoxicity research. A lack of standardization in the design of clinical studies in terms of age at exposure, duration and type of exposure, and outcome measures assessed were highlighted by all the investigators. Suggestions for the future direction of clinical trials included the implementation of more consistent study parameters and the employment of standardized neurocognitive testing and imaging before and after exposure to general anesthesia. Presentations covered a broad range of topics including the valid translation of preclinical studies to human subjects, the quantification of real-world exposures to anesthetic and sedative medications, and possible alternatives to these exposures.",,,,,10.1097/ANA.0000000000000543,2019-02-16,"[{'lastname': 'Haché', 'firstname': 'Manon', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology.'}, {'lastname': 'Hansen', 'firstname': 'Tom G', 'initials': 'TG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Odense University Hospital.\nDepartment of Clinical Research-Anaesthesiology, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Graham', 'firstname': 'Ruth', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesia, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Sinton', 'firstname': 'Jamie W', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.'}, {'lastname': 'Adams', 'firstname': 'Phillip S', 'initials': 'PS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh.'}, {'lastname': 'Garber', 'firstname': 'Carol', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': ""Department of Bio-behavioral Sciences, Teacher's College, Columbia University, New York, NY.""}, {'lastname': 'Maxwell', 'firstname': 'Lynne', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.'}, {'lastname': 'Pinyavat', 'firstname': 'Teeda', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology.'}]",10
Baby Panda World,30496102,"Global, regional, and national age-sex-specific mortality and life expectancy, 1950-2017: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017.",[],"Lancet (London, England)","Assessments of age-specific mortality and life expectancy have been done by the UN Population Division, Department of Economics and Social Affairs (UNPOP), the United States Census Bureau, WHO, and as part of previous iterations of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD). Previous iterations of the GBD used population estimates from UNPOP, which were not derived in a way that was internally consistent with the estimates of the numbers of deaths in the GBD. The present iteration of the GBD, GBD 2017, improves on previous assessments and provides timely estimates of the mortality experience of populations globally.
The GBD uses all available data to produce estimates of mortality rates between 1950 and 2017 for 23 age groups, both sexes, and 918 locations, including 195 countries and territories and subnational locations for 16 countries. Data used include vital registration systems, sample registration systems, household surveys (complete birth histories, summary birth histories, sibling histories), censuses (summary birth histories, household deaths), and Demographic Surveillance Sites. In total, this analysis used 8259 data sources. Estimates of the probability of death between birth and the age of 5 years and between ages 15 and 60 years are generated and then input into a model life table system to produce complete life tables for all locations and years. Fatal discontinuities and mortality due to HIV/AIDS are analysed separately and then incorporated into the estimation. We analyse the relationship between age-specific mortality and development status using the Socio-demographic Index, a composite measure based on fertility under the age of 25 years, education, and income. There are four main methodological improvements in GBD 2017 compared with GBD 2016: 622 additional data sources have been incorporated; new estimates of population, generated by the GBD study, are used; statistical methods used in different components of the analysis have been further standardised and improved; and the analysis has been extended backwards in time by two decades to start in 1950.
Globally, 18·7% (95% uncertainty interval 18·4-19·0) of deaths were registered in 1950 and that proportion has been steadily increasing since, with 58·8% (58·2-59·3) of all deaths being registered in 2015. At the global level, between 1950 and 2017, life expectancy increased from 48·1 years (46·5-49·6) to 70·5 years (70·1-70·8) for men and from 52·9 years (51·7-54·0) to 75·6 years (75·3-75·9) for women. Despite this overall progress, there remains substantial variation in life expectancy at birth in 2017, which ranges from 49·1 years (46·5-51·7) for men in the Central African Republic to 87·6 years (86·9-88·1) among women in Singapore. The greatest progress across age groups was for children younger than 5 years; under-5 mortality dropped from 216·0 deaths (196·3-238·1) per 1000 livebirths in 1950 to 38·9 deaths (35·6-42·83) per 1000 livebirths in 2017, with huge reductions across countries. Nevertheless, there were still 5·4 million (5·2-5·6) deaths among children younger than 5 years in the world in 2017. Progress has been less pronounced and more variable for adults, especially for adult males, who had stagnant or increasing mortality rates in several countries. The gap between male and female life expectancy between 1950 and 2017, while relatively stable at the global level, shows distinctive patterns across super-regions and has consistently been the largest in central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia, and smallest in south Asia. Performance was also variable across countries and time in observed mortality rates compared with those expected on the basis of development.
This analysis of age-sex-specific mortality shows that there are remarkably complex patterns in population mortality across countries. The findings of this study highlight global successes, such as the large decline in under-5 mortality, which reflects significant local, national, and global commitment and investment over several decades. However, they also bring attention to mortality patterns that are a cause for concern, particularly among adult men and, to a lesser extent, women, whose mortality rates have stagnated in many countries over the time period of this study, and in some cases are increasing.

The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-INCLEN collaboration undertook a nationwide exercise engaging faculty from 256 institutions to identify top research priorities in the MNCHN themes for 2016-2025. The Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative method of priority setting was adapted. The context of the exercise was defined by a National Steering Group (NSG) and guided by four Thematic Research Subcommittees. Research ideas were pooled from 498 experts located in different parts of India, iteratively consolidated into research options, scored by 893 experts against five pre-defined criteria (answerability, relevance, equity, investment and innovation) and weighed by a larger reference group. Ranked lists of priorities were generated for each of the four themes at national and three subnational (regional) levels [Empowered Action Group & North-Eastern States, Southern and Western States, & Northern States (including West Bengal)]. Research priorities differed between regions and from overall national priorities. Delivery domain of research which included implementation research constituted about 70 per cent of the top ten research options under all four themes. The results were endorsed in the NSG meeting. There was unanimity that the research priorities should be considered by different governmental and non-governmental agencies for investment with prioritization on implementation research and issues

Baby Panda World,28916366,Measuring progress and projecting attainment on the basis of past trends of the health-related Sustainable Development Goals in 188 countries: an analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016.,[],"Lancet (London, England)","The UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are grounded in the global ambition of ""leaving no one behind"". Understanding today's gains and gaps for the health-related SDGs is essential for decision makers as they aim to improve the health of populations. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016), we measured 37 of the 50 health-related SDG indicators over the period 1990-2016 for 188 countries, and then on the basis of these past trends, we projected indicators to 2030.
We used standardised GBD 2016 methods to measure 37 health-related indicators from 1990 to 2016, an increase of four indicators since GBD 2015. We substantially revised the universal health coverage (UHC) measure, which focuses on coverage of essential health services, to also represent personal health-care access and quality for several non-communicable diseases. We transformed each indicator on a scale of 0-100, with 0 as the 2·5th percentile estimated between 1990 and 2030, and 100 as the 97·5th percentile during that time. An index representing all 37 health-related SDG indicators was constructed by taking the geometric mean of scaled indicators by target. On the basis of past trends, we produced projections of indicator values, using a weighted average of the indicator and country-specific annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2016 with weights for each annual rate of change based on out-of-sample validity. 24 of the currently measured health-related SDG indicators have defined SDG targets, against which we assessed attainment.
Globally, the median health-related SDG index was 56·7 (IQR 31·9-66·8) in 2016 and country-level performance markedly varied, with Singapore (86·8, 95% uncertainty interval 84·6-88·9), Iceland (86·0, 84·1-87·6), and Sweden (85·6, 81·8-87·8) having the highest levels in 2016 and Afghanistan (10·9, 9·6-11·9), the Central African Republic (11·0, 8·8-13·8), and Somalia (11·3, 9·5-13·1) recording the lowest. Between 2000 and 2016, notable improvements in the UHC index were achieved by several countries, including Cambodia, Rwanda, Equatorial Guinea, Laos, Turkey, and China; however, a number of countries, such as Lesotho and the Central African Republic, but also high-income countries, such as the USA, showed minimal gains. Based on projections of past trends, the median number of SDG targets attained in 2030 was five (IQR 2-8) of the 24 defined targets currently measured. Globally, projected target attainment considerably varied by SDG indicator, ranging from more than 60% of countries projected to reach targets for under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality ratio, and malaria, to less than 5% of countries projected to achieve targets linked to 11 indicator targets, including those for childhood overweight, tuberculosis, and road injury mortality. For several of the health-related SDGs, meeting defined targets hinges upon substantially faster progress than what most countries have achieved in the past.
GBD 2016 provides an updated and expanded evidence base on where the world currently stands in terms of the health-related SDGs. Our improved measure of UHC offers a basis to monitor the expansion of health services necessary to meet the SDGs. Based on past rates of progress, many places are facing challenges in meeting defined health-related SDG targets, particularly among countries that are the worst off. In view of the early stages of SDG implementation, however, opportunity remains to take actions to accelerate progress, as shown by the catalytic effects of adopting the Millennium Development Goals after 2000. With the SDGs' broader, bolder development agenda, multisectoral commitments and investments are vital to make the health-related SDGs within reach of all populations.

Baby Panda World,27447463,"Complete genotyping of unusual species A rotavirus G12P[11] and G10P[14] isolates and evidence of frequent in vivo reassortment among the rotaviruses detected in children with diarrhea in Kolkata, India, during 2014.",[],Archives of virology,"Species A rotaviruses (RVA) are the most important cause of acute gastroenteritis in the young of humans and many animal species globally. G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8], G9P[6/8] and G12P[6/8] are the predominantly isolated genotypes throughout the world including India. Unusual genotypes from different host species such as G5, G6, G8, G10 and G11 have also been reported in humans with low frequency. In the present study, among >650 RVA positive stool samples collected from children with diarrhea in Kolkata, India, during 2014, two isolates each of the genotype G12P[11] and G10P[14] were obtained and their genomes completely sequenced. The full genotype constellations were G12-P[11]-I1-R1-C1-M2-A1-N1-T2-E1-H1 and G12-P[11]-I1-R1-C1-M1-A5-N1-T1-E1-H1 for G12P[11] viruses, suggesting several reassortments between Wa- and DS-1-like human RVA strains, including possible reassortment of a simian NSP1 gene. The G10P[14] viruses (G10-P[14]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A11-N2-T6-E2-H3) were found to contain multiple genes closely related to RVAs of artiodactyl origin, highlighting the role of inter-host species transmissions of RVAs. From the G/P constellation of all RVA isolates, it could be concluded that approximately one quarter had likely arisen from reassortment events in vivo among RVAs of 'usual' genotypes.

Baby Panda World,27365320,Usability and feasibility of a mobile health system to provide comprehensive antenatal care in low-income countries: PANDA mHealth pilot study in Madagascar.,"['Antenatal care', 'Madagascar', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'smartphone']",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,"Background Madagascar's maternal health mortality ratio in 2013 was 478 deaths per 100,000 live births. Most deaths are related to direct complications during pregnancy and childbirth and could be reduced by providing comprehensive antenatal care (ANC). Objective The objective of the study was to assess the usability and feasibility of a mobile health system (mHealth) to provide high-quality ANC, according to World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. Methods PANDA (Pregnancy And Newborn Diagnostic Assessment) is an easy-to-use mHealth system that uses affordable communications technology to support diagnosis and health care worker decision-making regarding ANC. From January to March 2015, a cross-sectional pilot study was conducted in Ambanja District, Madagascar, in which ANC using PANDA was provided to 100 pregnant women. The collected data were transmitted to a database in the referral hospital to create individual electronic patient records. Accuracy and completeness of the data were closely controlled. The PANDA software was assessed and the number of abnormal results, treatments performed, and participants requiring referral to health care facilities were monitored. Results The PANDA system facilitated creation of individual electronic patient records that included socio-demographic and medical data for 100 participants. Duration of ANC visits averaged 29.6 min. Health care providers were able to collect all variables (100%) describing personal and medical data. No major technical problems were encountered and no data were lost. During 17 ANC visits (17%), an alert function was generated to highlight abnormal clinical results requiring therapy or referral to an affiliated hospital. Participants' acceptability of the system was very high. Conclusion This pilot study proved the usability and feasibility of the PANDA mHealth system to conduct complete and standardised ANC visits according to WHO guidelines, thus providing a promising solution to increase access to high-quality and standardised ANC for pregnant women in remote areas.",,,,,10.1177/1357633X16653540,2016-07-02,"[{'lastname': 'Benski', 'firstname': 'Anne Caroline', 'initials': 'AC', 'affiliation': '1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospitals of Geneva, Switzerland.\n2 Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Stancanelli', 'firstname': 'Giovanna', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': '3 AISPO, Associazione Italiana Solidarietà tra I Popoli, Milan, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Scaringella', 'firstname': 'Stefano', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': '2 Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Herinainasolo', 'firstname': 'Josea Léa', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': '2 Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Jinoro', 'firstname': 'Jéromine', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': '2 Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Vassilakos', 'firstname': 'Pierre', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': '1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospitals of Geneva, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Petignat', 'firstname': 'Patrick', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': '1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospitals of Geneva, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Schmidt', 'firstname': 'Nicole C', 'initials': 'NC', 'affiliation': '1 Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospitals of Geneva, Switzerland.\n4 Centre Médico-chirurgical Saint Damien, Ambanja, Madagascar.'}]",10
Baby Panda World,24403352,Cardiac catheter procedures during extracorporeal life support: a risk-benefit analysis.,"['ECMO', 'cardiac catheterization']",World journal for pediatric & congenital heart surgery,"Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) is a valuable tool for situations in which cardiac disease acutely threatens the life of a child. Residual anatomic lesions have a strong negative influence on survival when ECLS is used after cardiac operations. Accurate diagnostic information is essential, and although noninvasive studies are preferred (eg, echocardiography and thoracic computed tomographic angiography), they are not always logistically practical nor adequate in complex situations under the loading and nonpulsatile flow conditions of ECLS.
We analyzed our experience (February 2009 to August 2012) with cardiac ECLS for 59 children. Of the 59 children, 22 (median age and weight 19.5 days and 4 kg) with advanced cardiac dysfunction had catheter studies performed during support.
The 22 patients had 28 studies, without major adverse events relating to the procedure or transport. Problems leading to further therapeutic procedures (catheter based seven, hybrid two, or surgical eight) were discovered in 17 of the 22 patients. For 22 catheterized patients, total time on ECLS, weaning probability, and survival to discharge were 151.6 ± 122.6 hours, 81%, and 68%, respectively, similar to that for the 37 cardiac support patients not requiring catheter studies during support (P = 0.94, 0.37, and 0.59, respectively).
Assuming that undiscovered anatomic and/or hemodynamic issues would have had a strong negative influence on survival, we may conclude that the risk-benefit ratio was positive and favorable. Catheter studies during ECLS are safe and should be performed expeditiously when diagnostic questions cannot be resolved by noninvasive means.","Assuming that undiscovered anatomic and/or hemodynamic issues would have had a strong negative influence on survival, we may conclude that the risk-benefit ratio was positive and favorable.

There are around 300 cases reported in the world medical literature to date. We report the case of a 40-year-old woman who presented with features of acute intestinal obstruction (abdominal distention, vomiting and absolute constipation) for a week. She had a past history of a missed abortion in the fifth month of gestation, eight years prior to this presentation, one which we thought to be irrelevant to the present illness. However, complementary investigations, including scout abdominal radiographs and ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis, were done before the operation. The abdominal radiograph showed two opaque globular masses on either side of the lower abdomen with distended small intestinal loops. Exploratory laparotomy was performed and a portion of strangulated small bowel attached to a solid globular mass behind the left ovary was removed, with a subsequent resection of the gut and end-to-end anastomosis. Upon removal of a thick membrane from the globular mass, a dead five-month-old calcified foetus was recovered.

A retrospective study was performed in 1000 eyes of 1000 patients with presumed microbial keratitis. Information was recorded on patients' age and gender, risk factors, seasonal presentation, number of days since initiation of ulcer, prior therapy, clinical presentation, microbiological work-up and case management.
Fifty per cent of the patients with corneal ulcers were aged between 36 and 65 years and 13.3% were in the paediatric age group (1 month to <16 years). The male : female ratio was almost 1.6:1. Only 11.4% of patients reported to the authors during the first week of initiation of ulcer. Trauma was the cause in 47.6% of eyes, and ocular surface diseases accounted for 16.6%. Forty-two per cent of eyes received topical antibiotics alone (either one or more) prior to hospital visit and 42.2% of eyes were on topical antibiotics and antifungals. Another 8.2% were on topical corticosteroids along with antibiotics and 4.6% were receiving some unidentified drop. Only 3% of the eyes did not receive any therapy prior to visit. Contact lens use as a risk factor could be identified only in 8.2% of eyes. Ulcers were central in location in 48%. Ulcer size 6-9 mm was observed in 51.7% of eyes. Medical therapy alone was effective in 61.0% of eyes and another 9.7% eyes responded to paramedian tarsorrhaphy along with topical antimicroboial drugs.
Corneal ulcers are a frequent problem in this part of the world. The ulcers seen at this tertiary referral hospital present late in the natural history of the disease and are clinically severe. Despite the severity a majority of the eyes could be saved anatomically, but almost 65% of eyes were left with a visual acuity of <6/120. Considering the high magnitude of visual loss, public education about the potential for loss of sight and the importance of timely and appropriate treatment is recommended.","Corneal ulcers are a frequent problem in this part of the world.

All these eyes were proven refractory to maximal medical therapy for extended periods of time, in some cases more than 6 weeks. As the surgery was performed during the active stage, the outcome was not favorable functionally. Clinical cure was obtained, however, by therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty in all but 27 of these eyes. Of unsuccessful cases, 16 could be saved with additional medical therapy, two led to phthisis bulbi, and nine required repeat therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty. Complications encountered included disturbances in intraocular dynamics such as extrusion of the lens and vitreous during surgery, secondary rise of intraocular pressure leading to damage of the optic nerve, loss of the eye due to above factors, and reinfection. The anatomical success achieved was 97% with graft clarity of 2+ or more in 39% of eyes. Useful vision, ie, better than or equal to 6/60, was possible in 33% of eyes.
