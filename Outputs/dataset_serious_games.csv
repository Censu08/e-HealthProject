This sensorial app has many unique features in comparison with other sensory based games, such as the firework, bubble, balloon pop and finger paint games available. Choose to amuse your baby with this visually stimulating, interactive, sensory game.

Not only will this sensory app delight your kids, it will also provide increased educational benefits. From the early stages of your babies development, they are constantly learning and absorbing information around them, they begin to see, touch, feel, hear and understand how their interactions are affecting the environment around them. Your baby will begin to learn that touching the screen will cause bubbles to be created. Your child can drag your finger across the screen to create a pattern of bubbles. Your newborn can place their hands on the screen to cause lots of bubbles to be created at all points on the screen that they are touching. 

With sensory fish, your child will experience and educate themselves by use of the cause and effect techniques and features implemented. As your baby touches the screen, they gain instant feedback of a vibration, sound effects and bubbles. They will eventually begin to understand that their touch is also causing the fish to swim towards where they touched. If they were to touch the screen in multiple position, the fish will swim between all of those touched positions! Your baby learns and adapts to their findings within the game. 

As the game is fairly simple to understand and not too complex, it is ideal for young kids, boys and girls of ages from 0 months (with a parent showing them the game), up to the late kindergarten / preschool stage of their development where they fully understand and can control all aspects of the world and have learned exactly what the cause will be from their actions.

Sensory game play is great for the continued development of your kids motor skills and hand eye coordination development. It aids in helping to fine tune the motoric skills and movements, the very detailed movements that we require and use every day.

It has also been shown to have great benefits in learning and stimulation for children with autism and children with special educational needs (SEN).

The most downloaded of all the kids educational apps on Google Play, Kids Preschool Puzzles Lite, contains two categories of puzzles to try out (Animals and Food), before you buy the full version (which contains Animals, Food, Transport, Sports, Professions, Geometric Figures, Numbers, Letters, and Assorted).

Your child will slide and snap the colorful puzzle pieces into place to reveal the delightful image.

Once kids complete the puzzle, the pleasant voice of a lady announcer congratulates the child on an excellent job and tells the child what the image depicts.

Children enjoy success time after time and receive positive reinforcement from the likable teacher. So they want to keep learning.

★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★
Like all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free. Kids Preschool Puzzles helps children build and practice cognitive skills, visual spatial skills, shape recognition, as well as tactile and fine motor skills.

★★★ What won't my children learn? ★★★
The game does not overload children and parents with too many audio and visual stimuli. Coping with stress and over-stimulation is therefore one skill that your kids won't be practicing during this game. Its clear focus makes the game a delight for children and a winning choice for parents.

Although it's perfect for preschoolers, who just love the game, many children of kindergarten age and in the early grades also enjoy snapping the puzzle pieces into place and learning the 100-plus images (in the full version) the puzzles represent.

✔ Our games are laser focused. For example, the numbers game doesn't teach letters, and the letters game doesn't teach math. We keep the games simple but magically inviting and nourishing.

✔ We strive to give children just the right balance between education and fun. So our games don't feature fun at the expense of education – or education at the expense of fun. We also know games that are too complicated don’t involve and delight kids.",3625,counting,children

Educational toys and aids that allow our little ones to fully utilize their natural desire to learn. When our children grow up and begin discovering the interesting world around them, it’s our job to help. We believe that this application will be very helpful.

The application called ""Trip to the zoo for kids"" presents various animals in a zoo. The game introduces various animals to the child (e.g. elephants, turtles, birds, dolphins and many others). The child leans what the animals eat, and how to fix a broken fence or tractor. This knowledge is acquired by performing actions in the right order, such as unscrewing a tractor wheel or washing and feeding animals.

The application has been designed to teach cause and effect. It stimulates the child’s senses through pictures, sounds and touch. 

The application is intended for children 3 to 5 years old. My child is 3 years old and absolutely loves it. I made this application as a parent, so my child could learn about the world on those cloudy days when it’s not so easy to just go for a walk.

I plan to expand the application, so I would love to hear your suggestions and advice. 

I WOULD ALSO INVITE YOU TO RATE THE APPLICATION. If there is a lot of interest, then we will definitely make new scenes.

Together with your child, you can watch wonderful images of different animals, all while learning their names and listen to the animals’ unique sounds!

These carefully selected photographs allow your child to not only learn the names of the various animals, but also glimpse into the animal’s beautiful world and everything it offers! 

After your child looks over and experiences the animal flashcards, there is a fun game waiting for them, which tests how much they’ve understood. Regardless of the number of correct answers, the player earns stars and young talent is rewarded with thunderous applause and balloons!

In the free app, the animals are divided into three groups: “domestic animals and pets”, “forest animals”, and “animals of the world” (animals that live in Asia, Africa, the Arctic, and Antarctic). Additional animals, like “birds”, “insects”, and “world of water” (fish and water-thriving animals), are available in the full version of the application. 

A significant feature of this app is that there are no unrealistic drawings. Instead, full-length beautiful pictures are used that resemble actual animals (as they look in real life), which helps the child easily remember their names and features. 

Do you have older children in primary school? If so, this educational game will also come in handy for them because in addition to English, the app supports German, Spanish, French and some other foreign languages.

Playing these types of games with flashcards has been proven to aid students in quickly learning a foreign language.  They can discover new words and are able to easily impress their teachers and classmates!

Your child doesn’t even need to know how to read with this app! Its simple interface and voice prompts allow even the youngest kid to play and learn the names of the animals by themselves! After playing the game, be sure to visit the zoo or pet store with your child – you’ll be happy and impressed as they present their newly acquired knowledge of all the animals they see!

Experience has shown that for most children, viewing and learning from bright and vivid images becomes a favorite pastime and having them play this game often reinforces their knowledge. According to Glenn Doman, an American physical therapist and founder of the “The Institutes for The Achievement of Human Potential”, training just 5 - 10 minutes a day stimulates the development of various parts of the brain. This allows for the development of a photographic memory, which means your could can develop faster than her or his peers, and become more open to the vast knowledge of the world.

Doman is undoubtedly right! The younger the child, the easier they absorb new information. 

Don’t delay!

The app can be used as a supplementary teaching aid in foreign language instruction. Supported languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian.",273,language,children

Right from the outset there are different toys and aids for toddlers that make it possible to fully exploit their enthusiasm and willingness to learn. When a child grows up, it starts to discover the surrounding world and it is our task to give a helping hand in this regard. We believe that this application will be very useful while doing this.

The purpose of the application, named “Preschooler World”, is to expand the child's vocabulary and to teach it the principle of cause and effect by the appropriate performing of tasks in the game. While playing, the child learns to connect elements in pairs, to tidy up the room, and to mark hot objects which shouldn't be touched. The game contains many other additional levels to aid the development of the child.

The application stimulates the child’s senses through sight, sound and touch. 

The application is designed for children aged between 2.5 and 4 years. This application was created by me as a parent in order for a child to more easily learn about the surrounding world on cloudy days when taking a walk isn't that easy. We should remember, however, that there is no substitute for time spent with a child. Therefore, we should try our best in order to spend this play time together with our child.

I intend to further develop this application, so I would appreciate any suggestions and advice. 

I ENCOURAGE YOU TO EVALUATE THE APPLICATION AS WELL. If there is big enough interest in the application, we will certainly create new scenes.

Its six sections include:

★ <b>Skateboards and Helmet</b>: children practice reading as they are asked to fit Tommy's animal friends with skateboards and helmets
.
★ <b>Turn the Blocks</b>: kids make words in a way that's fun by turning real-looking blocks with letters on each side until the word is spelled out.

★ <b>Word Ball</b>: children learn to identify spoken words by helping Tommy bat the right ball (only available in full version)

★ <b>Word Magic</b>: kids learn about word families as they fill the corresponding pot with potion and watch magic happen (only available in full version)

★ <b>Rocket Words</b>: children get to practice word families as they assemble and launch a rocket into space (only available in full version)

If your children do not know the alphabet sounds yet, we recommend our  Learn Letter Sounds with Carnival Kids app. And if your kids need to learn or practice the names of the letters, try our Learn ABC Letters with Captain Cat app.

SpeakTribe, your personal coach, will help you learn basics including vocabulary and pronunciation in a fun and easy way.

The design of the course is based on scientific research which tells that, to understand basics of a language you need not master a large vocabulary. SpeakTribe introduces you to the more common words and phrases first, so that by the end of first day itself you can form your own basic sentences which are not just academic but also practical. 

There are many other guiding principles behind the design -
   * Language is primarily vocal - SpeakTribe emphasises on listening and speaking more than anything else, the two faculties which are also the most useful to a new learner.
   * You need to practice a language to master it and gain confidence. And so, SpeakTribe provides you ability to chat (speak) with the application.
   * Any language has a small number of prepositions and conjunctions, some of which take some time to master but are crucial to your understanding of the language.
   * Noun words constitute the majority of a mature vocabulary but they do not give you the best ROI initially in terms understanding a language. Once you have a solid foundation built, you will find picking up these words pretty easy.
   * Verbs are the most useful but the most difficult set to master.

If you’re tired of boring learning apps that don't give you any freedom to choose your own educational journey MySchool is for you! 

Unlike other learning apps, with MySchool you are the teacher at school and the master of your education! Our education app has a classroom game for every elementary school grade level. These games are designed by real teachers and curriculum experts! 

Teach your students, give them practice solving math problems, keep them from messing around in class, and more. Best of all you can tell your parents that you’re not playing games but focusing on your education 😉.

🛎️Start the school day by ringing the bell, and opening the class book to take attendance. Then begin a lesson solving math problems or teaching English to your students. 

✏️As you ask your students the lesson questions, you will call on them to provide an answer, and let them know if they are correct or not. 

📖By accurately letting the students know if they picked the right answer, you will progress through the game and earn points that you can use to buy items to decorate your classroom. Moreover, you will unlock exercises to help you practice solving math problems and learn grammar. 

📗Each level of the game has a different set of tasks that you need to complete. At some levels you will have to correct tests, and solve grammatical problems. At other levels you will be asked to create homework questions and solve math problems. 

🐰Once you have enough points, you can even buy a classroom pet rabbit! But be careful, as the rabbit needs to be fed and their cage has to be cleaned or they will become really sad! 

🍎You can also grow your classroom by adding more desks and students! 

💯Further along in the game, you can create your own school and invite your friends to join it! Have fun creating custom homework and tests for your students to challenge them!

🎓And remember, if you get bored of a classroom game in one grade level, MySchool has 1st grade learning games, 2nd grade learning games, 3rd grade learning games, 4th grade learning games, and 5th grade learning games where you can take the fun and learning to the next grade level!",4468,counting,adults

Learn Hebrew.

Mondly is the quick fix that will teach you core Hebrew words and Hebrew phrases for conversation, just like a phrasebook. If you want to learn beyond the basics, there are also Hebrew grammar lessons available. It’s even great for kids!

With Mondly you can learn Hebrew sentences and expressions FREE with daily Hebrew language lessons online. This app is the effective way for beginners to study verbs, pronunciation and how to speak like a native with daily practice.

<b>The secret path to language learning</b>
Remember the Hebrew language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of Hebrew grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a local. Does it sound familiar? That’s the traditional way to learn a language. But it’s not the fastest and not the most efficient way.
Mondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.

<b>This is how the future of language courses looks like</b>
The App gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It’s an effective way to learn Hebrew phrases. State-of-the-art Natural Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.

Here are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:

<b>- Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors.</b> Learn the right Hebrew pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.

<b>- State-of-the-art Speech Recognition.</b> Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your Hebrew words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak Hebrew clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.

<b>- Useful phrases for real situations.</b> Memorizing hundreds of words is not the way to go when it comes to learning Hebrew. Mondly teaches you Hebrew vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into bite-size chunks and puts them into themed packs of lessons.

<b>- Learn conversational Hebrew.</b> Unless you plan on reading science books, conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core Hebrew vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs and speak Hebrew clearly.

<b>- Verb conjugations.</b> Conversations are fun, but the foundation of a foreign language is grammar. If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the Hebrew verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.

<b>- Statistics that make sense.</b> The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.

<b>- The Leaderboard.</b> We made learning easy and fun, so why not throw in some more game elements, such as score? See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.

<b>- Adaptive Learning.</b> We wanted to craft Mondly in such a way that it will suit every learner’s needs, even complete beginners. Along the way we noticed that learning Hebrew is different from person to person. So we taught the app to learn from your way of learning. After little time spent together, Mondly will understand what suits you best and it will become your own guide and customized teacher.

Before you know it, at the end of these Hebrew lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language. Kids will love it as well.",1225,language,children

Mondly is the quick fix that will teach you core Dutch words and Dutch phrases for conversation, just like a phrasebook. If you want to learn beyond the basics, there are also Dutch grammar lessons available. It’s even great for kids!

With Mondly you can learn Dutch sentences and expressions FREE with daily Dutch language lessons online. This app is the effective way for beginners to study verbs, pronunciation and how to speak like a native with daily practice.

<b>The secret path to language learning</b>
Remember the Dutch language classes in school? You started with hundreds of basic words and expressions, continued with tons of Dutch grammar lessons and at the end of a full semester’s language course you could barely translate a sentence or say “Hello!” to a local. Does it sound familiar? That’s the traditional way to learn a language. But it’s not the fastest and not the most efficient way.
Mondly has a different approach, that’s opposite to the average language course.

<b>This is how the future of language courses looks like</b>
The App gets you started with a basic conversation between two people. You quickly start memorizing core words, use them to build sentences and phrases, and at the end of a 45-minutes module you are able to reconstruct that conversation with your own voice. It’s an effective way to learn Dutch phrases. State-of-the-art Natural Speech Recognition and Spaced Repetition Algorithms make the app effective for learning languages.

Here are the key features that make Mondly a great tutor for you:

<b>- Crystal-clear audio and professional voice actors.</b> Learn the right Dutch pronunciation from conversations between native speakers.

<b>- State-of-the-art Speech Recognition.</b> Mondly knows exactly how to listen to your Dutch words and phrases. You will only get a positive feedback if you speak Dutch clearly and correctly. This will improve your pronunciation.

<b>- Useful phrases for real situations.</b> Memorizing hundreds of words is not the way to go when it comes to learning Dutch. Mondly teaches you Dutch vocabulary by offering you core words and phrases. The app breaks the learning process down into bite-size chunks and puts them into themed packs of lessons.

<b>- Learn conversational Dutch.</b> Unless you plan on reading science books, conversation is the main reason to take this free course. It will help you build a core Dutch vocabulary with widely-used nouns and verbs and speak Dutch clearly.

<b>- Verb conjugations.</b> Conversations are fun, but the foundation of a foreign language is grammar. If you want to learn more during this course, just tap the Dutch verbs and get the full conjugation on the screen, including the translation. It’s faster and better than a dictionary.

<b>- Statistics that make sense.</b> The App uses intelligent reporting, so you can always follow your progress. Build your vocabulary step by step and become better daily.

<b>- The Leaderboard.</b> We made learning easy and fun, so why not throw in some more game elements, such as score? See how your friends are doing and compete with people from all over the world to become the best learner in the Mondly family. Take the Weekly Quiz to become even better.

<b>- Adaptive Learning.</b> We wanted to craft Mondly in such a way that it will suit every learner’s needs, even complete beginners. Along the way we noticed that learning Dutch is different from person to person. So we taught the app to learn from your way of learning. After little time spent together, Mondly will understand what suits you best and it will become your own guide and customized teacher.

Before you know it, at the end of these Dutch lessons, you will master the most useful 5000 words and phrases and you will be on the fast lane to learning a new language. Kids will love it as well.",213,language,children

This knowledge will be gained by performing tasks such as unscrewing the wheels in the tractor (by moving the wrench on the nut), mowing the grain, feeding animals and many others.

This application teaches a cause and effect relationship and stimulates the child's senses through image, sound and touch. 

The application is designed for kids between 3 and 8 years, but my baby loves it as well, although he's only 2.5 years old.
