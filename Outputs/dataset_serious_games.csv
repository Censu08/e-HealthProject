Educational toys and aids that allow our little ones to fully utilize their natural desire to learn. When our children grow up and begin discovering the interesting world around them, it‚Äôs our job to help. We believe that this application will be very helpful.

The application called ""Trip to the zoo for kids"" presents various animals in a zoo. The game introduces various animals to the child (e.g. elephants, turtles, birds, dolphins and many others). The child leans what the animals eat, and how to fix a broken fence or tractor. This knowledge is acquired by performing actions in the right order, such as unscrewing a tractor wheel or washing and feeding animals.

The application has been designed to teach cause and effect. It stimulates the child‚Äôs senses through pictures, sounds and touch. 

The application is intended for children 3 to 5 years old. My child is 3 years old and absolutely loves it. I made this application as a parent, so my child could learn about the world on those cloudy days when it‚Äôs not so easy to just go for a walk.

I plan to expand the application, so I would love to hear your suggestions and advice.

It will allow your child to meet the basic animals (such as chickens, ducks, cows, pigs) and activities in the country. The child also learns where does the milk, cheese, honey come from, how to fix a fence or replace the tires on the tractor. 

This knowledge will be gained by performing tasks such as unscrewing the wheels in the tractor (by moving the wrench on the nut), mowing the grain, feeding animals and many others.

This application teaches a cause and effect relationship and stimulates the child's senses through image, sound and touch. 

The application is designed for kids between 3 and 8 years, but my baby loves it as well, although he's only 2.5 years old. This application was created by me as a parent, so that the child could more easily get to know the world around them on cloudy days when going out for a walk is not so simple.

I intend to develop this application, so I will be grateful for any suggestions and advice.
