,"Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) transcripts capture audio data within cockpit environments. This aids the investigation of causal factors contributing to aviation accidents by revealing communication and other sounds prior to aviation accidents. This dataset contains 172 unique CVR transcripts (with 21,626 lines of transcript: averaging: 106.001 conversational turns; SD¬†=¬†51.727, range: 1-641), and capturing approximately 15% of historic aviation fatalities in commercial and corporate aviation between 1962 and 2018. CVR transcripts involved airlines registered across 42 countries, with accidents occurring across 50 countries. The dataset was compiled by extracting CVR transcripts from three primary data sources and excluding duplicate and non-English entries. The data contains variables describing the (i) raw data, (ii) content and characteristics of the CVR transcripts, and (iii) behaviours coded by research assistants in support of the associated research article.

,"The study examined EFL instructors' perceptions of English textbooks. It also investigated whether the instructors' gender and the type of textbooks they used had a significant impact on their responses. A survey questionnaire with 30 closed-ended items was utilized to collect the data from 60 randomly selected EFL instructors who were teaching English in higher education institutions and English language centers. SPSS version 26.0 was used to analyze the data. The findings showed that the instructors had positive perceptions about English textbooks. They also believed that four skills of English were equally represented in the textbooks, and they contained adequate listening, speaking, reading and writing activities. In addition, the textbooks were enriched with the cultural issues of the target language and that they were appropriate for the Afghan context. The results also showed that textbooks served various roles in EFL classrooms, for instance, as a source of assessment and assignment. There were not statistically significant differences between female and male instructors' responses. However, the type of textbooks they used significantly impacted their perceptions of English textbooks. EFL Programs are recommended to encourage and support their instructors to use other English learning resources to optimize their students' learning.",['English Listening and Speaking'],"[{'lastname': 'Orfan', 'firstname': 'Sayeed Naqibullah', 'initials': 'SN', 'affiliation': 'English Department, Takhar University, Afghanistan.'}, {'lastname': 'Noori', 'firstname': 'Abdul Qawi', 'initials': 'AQ', 'affiliation': 'English Department, Takhar University, Afghanistan.'}, {'lastname': 'Akramy', 'firstname': 'Sayeed Asif', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'English Department, Takhar University, Afghanistan.'}]",,¬© 2021 The Author(s).,10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08340,Heliyon,"['EFL', 'Instructional materials', 'Internationally-published', 'Locally-published', 'Textbook']",,2021-11-26,34820543,,Afghan EFL instructors' perceptions of English textbooks.,7

,"The purpose of this study was to (1) develop a Language-independent Test of Auditory Discrimination (LIT-AD) between speech sounds so that people with hearing loss who derive limited speech perception benefits from hearing aids (HAs) may be identified for consideration of cochlear implantation and (2) examine the relationship between the scores for the new discrimination test and those of a standard sentence test for adults wearing either HAs or cochlear implants (CIs).
The test measures the ability of the listener to correctly discriminate pairs of nonsense syllables, presented as sequential triplets in an odd-one-out format, implemented as a game-based software tool for self-administration using a tablet computer. Stage 1 included first a review of phonemic inventories in the 40 most common languages in the world to select the consonants and vowels. Second, discrimination testing of 50 users of CIs at several signal to noise ratios (SNRs) was carried out to generate psychometric functions. These were used to calculate the corrections in SNR for each consonant-pair and vowel combination required to equalize difficulty across items. Third, all items were individually equalized in difficulty and the overall difficulty set. Stage 2 involved the validation of the LIT-AD in English-speaking listeners by comparing discrimination scores with performance in a standard sentence test. Forty-one users of HAs and 40 users of CIs were assessed. Correlation analyses were conducted to examine test-retest reliability and the relationship between performance in the two tests. Multiple regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between demographic characteristics and performance in the LIT-AD. The scores of the CI users were used to estimate the probability of superior performance with CIs for a non-CI user having a given LIT-AD score and duration of hearing loss.
The LIT-AD comprises 81 pairs of vowel-consonant-vowel syllables that were equalized in difficulty to discriminate. The test can be self-administered on a tablet computer, and it takes about 10‚Äâmin to complete. The software automatically scores the responses and gives an overall score and a list of confusable items as output. There was good test-retest reliability. On average, higher LIT-AD discrimination scores were associated with better sentence perception for users of HAs (r = -0.54, p <0.001) and users of CIs (r = -0.73, p <0.001). The probability of superior performance with CIs for a certain LIT-AD score was estimated, after allowing for the effect of duration of hearing loss.
The LIT-AD could increase access to CIs by screening for those who obtain limited benefits from HAs to facilitate timely referrals for CI candidacy evaluation. The test results can be used to provide patients and professionals with practical information about the probability of potential benefits for speech perception from cochlear implantation. The test will need to be evaluated for speakers of languages other than English to facilitate adoption in different countries.",['English Listening and Speaking'],"[{'lastname': 'Ching', 'firstname': 'Teresa Y C', 'initials': 'TYC', 'affiliation': ""National Acoustic Laboratories, Hearing Australia, Sydney, Australia Department of Linguistics, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia Manchester Centre for Audiology and Deafness, School of Health Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom Facult√© de Pharmacie, Universit√© de Montpellier, Montpellier, France Laboratoire de M√©canique et d'Acoustique, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Aix-Marseille University, Centrale Marseille, France.""}, {'lastname': 'Dillon', 'firstname': 'Harvey', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Hou', 'firstname': 'Sanna', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Seeto', 'firstname': 'Mark', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Sodan', 'firstname': 'Ana', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Chong-White', 'firstname': 'Nicky', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': None}]",,"Copyright ¬© 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

,"The aim of this study was to describe a new type of medical device that allows for internet-enabled patient self-screening, without the aid of an ophthalmic professional, through biomicroscopy self-imaging and self-measurement of the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA).
In this prospective nonrandomized comparative study, 56 patients were instructed to screen their own eyes using a custom-built e-Device containing miniaturized slitlamp optics and a visual acuity Snellen chart virtually projected at 20 ft. BCVA measurements were recorded, and biomicroscopic videos were scored for image quality of the anterior segment status on a scale from 1 to 5 (1 = poor and 5 = excellent) by a blinded observer.
After a short instruction, all patients were able to self-image their eyes and perform a self-BCVA measurement using the e-Device. Patient self-image quality with the e-Device scored on average 3.3 (¬±0.8) for videos (n = 76) and 3.6 (¬±0.6) for photographs (n = 49). Self-BCVA measurement was within 1 Snellen line from routine BCVA levels in 66 of 72 eyes (92%). When compared with conventional biomicroscopy, patient self-biomicroscopy allowed for recognition of the relevant pathology (or absence thereof) in 26 of 35 eyes (74%); 9 cases showed insufficient image quality attributed to device operating error (n = 6) and mild corneal edema and/or scarring (n = 3). Patient satisfaction with the device was 4.4 (¬±0.9).

,"Production, marketability and consumer preference of red tilapia often depends upon the intensity of coloration. Hence, new approaches to develop coloration are now geared to improve market acceptability and profit. This study evaluated the effects of carotenoid-rich diets on the phenotypic coloration, carotenoid level, weight gain and expression of coloration-linked genes in skin, fin and muscle tissues. Carotenoids were extracted from dried Daucus carota peel, Ipomoea aquatica leaves, and Moringa oleifera leaves. Eighty (80) size-14 fish were fed with carotenoid-rich treatments twice a day for 120‚Äâdays. The phenotypic effect of the carotenoid extracts was measured through a color chart. Skin carotenoid level was measured through UV-vis spectrophotometer. csf1ra, Bcdo2 and StAR expression analysis was done using qRT-PCR.
Treatments with carotenoid extracts yielded higher overall scores on phenotypic coloration and tissue carotenoid levels. Differential expression of carotenoid-linked genes such as the elevated expression in csf1ra and lower expression in Bcdo2b following supplementation of the enhanced diet supports the phenotypic redness and increased carotenoid values in red tilapia fed with D. carota peel and I. aquatica leaves.
Overall improvement in the redness of the tilapia was achieved through the supplementation of carotenoid-rich diet derived from readily available plants. Differential expression of coloration-linked genes supports the increase in the intensity of phenotypic coloration and level of carotenoids in the tissues. The study emphasizes the importance of carotenoids in the commercial tilapia industry and highlights the potential of the plant extracts for integration and development of feeds for color enhancement in red tilapia.",['Star Chart'],"[{'lastname': 'Judan Cruz', 'firstname': 'Khristina G', 'initials': 'KG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, Central Luzon State University, Nueva Ecija, Science City of Munoz, Philippines. kjcruz@clsu.edu.ph.'}, {'lastname': 'Landingin', 'firstname': 'Ervee P', 'initials': 'EP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, Central Luzon State University, Nueva Ecija, Science City of Munoz, Philippines.'}, {'lastname': 'Gajeton', 'firstname': 'Maureen B', 'initials': 'MB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, Central Luzon State University, Nueva Ecija, Science City of Munoz, Philippines.'}, {'lastname': 'Fernando', 'firstname': 'Somar Israel D', 'initials': 'SID', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Sciences, College of Science, Central Luzon State University, Nueva Ecija, Science City of Munoz, Philippines.'}, {'lastname': 'Watanabe', 'firstname': 'Kozo', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Ehime University, Bunkyo-cho 3, Matsuyama, 790-8577, Japan.\nCenter for Marine Environmental Studies (CMES), Ehime University, Bunkyo-cho 2-5, Matsuyama, Ehime, 790-8577, Japan.'}]",,¬© 2021.

,"Statin Therapy for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease (SPC) is a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Star measure added to Medicare Part C (Medicare Advantage) plans in 2019 to incentivize statin use for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The measure assesses statin dispensing and adherence in patients with atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD). Clinical pharmacists are well-positioned to affect positively a health system's performance on the SPC measure.
To assess the effect of telephone outreach by clinical pharmacists on moderate- or high-intensity statin prescribing in patients with ASCVD.
Patients in managed care health plans who meet the SPC measure criteria and are not currently receiving a moderate- to high-intensity statin therapy were contacted by a clinical pharmacist through telephone outreach. If appropriate, they were prescribed a statin by a clinical pharmacist. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients who meet the SPC measure classification and had 1 confirmed prescription fill for a moderate- or high-intensity statin after intervention by a clinical pharmacist.
A total of 84 patients were identified for review and outreach, of whom 35 (41.7%) met the SPC measure criteria. Of these 35 patients, 16 (45.7%) were female and the mean age was 66 years. A total of 22 (62.9%) patients agreed to a statin prescription, and 16 (72.7%) of these patients picked up the prescription within 10 days of prescribing. An additional 4 patients, for a total of 20 (57.1%) of the 35 eligible patients, were eventually dispensed a statin. Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) vendor data available after the intervention showed a larger SPC measure population than was captured with the health plan's internal report. HEDIS data showed an increase in statin prescribing for patients meeting the SPC measure classification from 24.7% to 56.6% during the study period (

,"Open globe injury is a frequent and preventable healthcare problem with an annual incidence of 3.5/100,000 worldwide. Management and treatment methods aim to ensure globe integrity. Unfortunately, it is not possible to achieve globe integrity in some of the cases, and these can result in poor visual outcomes.
To evaluate the usability of lamellar scleral graft in the repair of ocular perforations.
This was a retrospective review of 11 patients who underwent lamellar scleral graft surgery for ocular perforation between June 2015 and June 2020. Due to the failure of the repairs when other techniques were used, the perforation zones were sealed with lamellar scleral autografts. The primary measures of the outcomes were globe integrity, postoperative best corrected visual acuity, and intraocular pressure (IOP). Visual acuity was determined using the Snellen eye chart, and IOP was measured using the automated pneumatic tonometry during standard examination.
The participants enrolled in this study included 11 patients who underwent lamellar scleral patch graft between 2015 and 2020. The mean age of the patients was 58.81‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ16.6¬†years (range, 16-77), and the mean follow-up period was 12.5‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ3.8¬†months (range, 8-20). During the surgery, the perforation zone was treated and no leakage was observed. IOP significantly increased, and visual acuity improved in almost all eyes. The factors that made it necessary to use scleral grafts in patients were star-shaped wounds, delayed presentation, lost corneal / scleral tissue.

Retrospective chart review.
Patients with intermediate ARMD treated with a single session of SNL (2RT¬Æ, Ellex R&D Pty Ltd, Adelaide, Australia) were included. Swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging (Triton; Topcon Medical Systems, Tokyo, Japan) was performed within 6 months before and after SNL treatment. Retinal layers were segmented using the artificial intelligence-enabled Orion¬Æ software (Voxeleron LLC, San Francisco, USA). The macular region was analyzed according to the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study map. Mean difference and standard deviation in baseline and post-treatment retinal layer thicknesses are reported.
37 eyes from 25 patients were included in this study (mean age 74.7¬±9.2 years). An average of 51¬±6 spots were applied around the macula of each study eye, with a mean spot power of 0.33¬±0.04mJ. Increases in total retinal thickness were observed within the outer temporal and inferior sectors (P<0.05). Within the annulus, there was an increase in thickness of the sub-retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) space [0.88¬±2.41Œºm, P = 0.03], defined between the RPE and Bruch's membrane. An increase in thickness of 1.13¬±2.55Œºm (P = 0.01) was also noted in the inferior sector of the photoreceptor complex, defined from the inner and outer segment junction to the RPE.

,"To examine the effect of the Virtual Sprouts intervention, an interactive multiplatform mobile gardening game, on dietary intake and psychosocial determinants of dietary behavior in minority youth.
In this quasi-experimental pilot intervention, 180 third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade students in Los Angeles Unified School District participated in a 3-week program that included three Virtual Sprouts gaming sessions, three in-school lessons, and three in-home activities, using a nutrition- and gardening-focused curriculum. Pre- and postintervention questionnaires were used to assess psychosocial determinants of dietary behavior, including knowledge about and self-efficacy to eat fruits and vegetables (FV). Data were collected on FV, whole grains, fiber, total sugar, added sugar, and energy from sugary beverages through the Block Kids Food Screener (""last week"" version) for Ages 2-17. Repeated measures analysis of covariance models was used for continuous outcomes, controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, school, and free school lunch.
After the intervention, the intervention group (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ116) compared with the control group (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ64) had a significantly improved self-efficacy to eat FV score (+1.6% vs. -10.3%, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.01), and an improved self-efficacy to cook FV score (+2.9% vs. -5.0%, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.05). There were no significant differences in dietary intake or self-efficacy to garden scores between intervention and control groups.

,"USA Football established five levels-of-contact to guide the intensity of high school football practices. The objective of this study was to examine head impact frequency and magnitude by levels-of-contact to determine which drills had the greatest head impact exposure. Our primary hypothesis was that there would be an incremental increase in season-long head impact exposure between levels-of-contact: air<bags<control<thud<live. This observational study included 24 high-school football players during all 46 practices, 1 scrimmage, 9 junior varsity and 10 varsity games in the 2019 season. Players wore a sensor-installed mouthguard that monitored head impact frequency, peak linear acceleration (PLA), and rotational acceleration (PRA). Practice/game drills were filmed and categorized into five levels-of-contact (air, bags, control, thud, live), and head impact data were assigned into one of five levels-of-contact. Player position was categorized into lineman, hybrid, and skill. A total of 6016 head impacts were recorded during 5 levels-of-contact throughout the season. In the overall sample, total number of impacts, sum of PLA, and PRA per player increased in a near incremental manner (air<bags<control = thud<live), where live drills had significantly higher cumulative frequency (113.7¬±17.8 hits/player) and magnitude [2,657.6¬±432.0 g (PLA), and 233.9 ¬± 40.1 krad/s2 (PRA)] than any other levels-of-contact, whereas air drills showed the lowest cumulative frequency (7.7¬±1.9 hits/player) and magnitude [176.9¬±42.5 g (PLA), PRA 16.7¬±4.2 krad/s2 (PRA)]. There was no significant position group difference in cumulative head impact frequency and magnitude in a season. Although there was no difference in average head impact magnitude across five levels-of-contact and by position group PLA (18.2-23.2g) and PRA (1.6-2.3krad/s2) per impact], high magnitude (60-100g and >100g) head impacts were more frequently observed during live and thud drills. Level-of-contact influences cumulative head impact frequency and magnitude in high-school football, with players incurring frequent, high magnitude head impacts during live, thud, and control. It is important to consider level-of-contact to refine clinical exposure guidelines to minimize head impact burden in high-school football.",['Peak ‚Äì Brain Games & Training'],"[{'lastname': 'Kercher', 'firstname': 'Kyle', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Applied Health Science, School of Public Health-Bloomington, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Steinfeldt', 'firstname': 'Jesse A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Counseling and Educational Psychology, School of Education, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Macy', 'firstname': 'Jonathan T', 'initials': 'JT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Applied Health Science, School of Public Health-Bloomington, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Ejima', 'firstname': 'Keisuke', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health-Bloomington, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Kawata', 'firstname': 'Keisuke', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Kinesiology, School of Public Health-Bloomington, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, United States of America.\nProgram in Neuroscience, College of Arts and Sciences, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, United States of America.'}]",,,10.1371/journal.pone.0237800,PloS one,[],,2020-08-17,32797073,,Subconcussive head impact exposure between drill intensities in U.S. high school football.,10
,"The decline of cognitive function is an important issue related to aging. Over the last few years, numerous mobile apps have been developed to challenge the brain with cognitive exercises; however, little is currently known about how age influences capacity for performance improvement when playing cognitive mobile games.
The objective of this study was to analyze the score data of cognitive mobile games over a period of 100 gaming sessions to determine age-related learning ability for new cognitive tasks by measuring the level of score improvement achieved by participants of different ages.
Scores from 9000 individuals of different ages for 7 cognitive mobile games over 100 gaming sessions were analyzed. Scores from the first session were compared between age groups using one-way analysis of variance. Mixed models were subsequently used to investigate the progression of scores over 100 sessions.
Statistically significant differences were found between age groups for the initial scores of 6 of the 7 games (linear trend, P<.001). Cognitive mobile game scores increased for all participants (P<.001) suggesting that all participants were able to improve their performance. The rate of improvement was, however, strongly influenced by the age of the participant with slower progression for older participants (P<.001).
This study provides evidence to support two interesting insights-cognitive mobile game scores appear to be sensitive to the changes in cognitive ability that occur with advancing age; therefore, these games could be a convenient way to monitor cognitive function over long-term follow-up, and users who train with the cognitive mobile games improve regardless of age.",['Peak ‚Äì Brain Games & Training'],"[{'lastname': 'Bonnech√®re', 'firstname': 'Bruno', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Centre de Recherche en Epid√©miologie, Biostatistiques et Recherche Clinique, Ecole de Sant√© Publique, Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Behavioural and Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Bier', 'firstname': 'Jean-Christophe', 'initials': 'JC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, H√¥pital √ârasme, Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Van Hove', 'firstname': 'Olivier', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chest and Thoracic Surgery, H√¥pital √ârasme, Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Sheldon', 'firstname': 'Sally', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Peak Brain Training, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Samadoulougou', 'firstname': 'S√©kou', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Evaluation Platform on Obesity Prevention, Quebec Heart and Lung Institute Research Centre, Quebec City, QC, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Kirakoya-Samadoulougou', 'firstname': 'Fati', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Centre de Recherche en Epid√©miologie, Biostatistiques et Recherche Clinique, Ecole de Sant√© Publique, Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Klass', 'firstname': 'Malgorzata', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Applied Biology and Neurophysiology, Neuroscience Institute, Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.'}]",,"¬©Bruno Bonnech√®re, Jean-Christophe Bier, Olivier Van Hove, Sally Sheldon, S√©kou Samadoulougou, Fati Kirakoya-Samadoulougou, Malgorzata Klass.

,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures employed by the government have forced neurologists across the world to look upon telemedicine as the only feasible and practical option to continue providing health care towards children with epilepsy in home isolation. Children with epilepsy are challenging for teleconsultation as direct information from the patient is missing, regarding seizures and adverse effects, especially behavioral and psychological side effects.
Clinical and epilepsy-related details of telephonic consultations for children 1 month-18 years, performed between 26th March and 17th May 2020 in a tertiary care teaching hospital in Uttarakhand (a state of India known for hilly terrains with low per capita income) were recorded. Suitable changes in the dose/commercial brand of antiepileptic drug (AED) regimen were performed, along with the addition of new AED and referral to local practitioners for immediate hospitalization, when urgent health care issues were detected. Voice call, text message, picture/video message, and all other possible measures were employed to accumulate maximum clinical information in real-time.
A total of 153 children(95 males [62 %], 9.45‚ÄØ¬±‚ÄØ3.24 years, 140 lower/middle socioeconomic status) were enrolled after screening 237 children with various neurological disorders, whose caregivers contacted for teleconsultation. A total of 278 telephone consultations performed for these 153 children (1-5 telephone calls per patient). Hundred-thirteen children were identified to have a total of 152 significant clinical events (breakthrough seizure/uncontrolled epilepsy (108), AED related (13), and unrelated systemic adverse effects (24), worsening of associated co-morbidities (7). In rest of the patients, the query of the caregiver included unavailability of AED/prescribed commercial brand in the locality, query related to the dose of drugs, proxy for a scheduled routine visit (no active issues), and concern regarding COVID-19 related symptoms and effect of COVID-19 and lockdown in children with epilepsy. Ninety-three (60 %) patients required hiking up of AED dose, whereas 29 (17 %) patients required the addition of a new AED/commercial brand. Five children were advised immediate admission to a nearby hospital. Overall, 147 (96 %) caregivers were satisfied with the quality of medical advice.

,"India has been reporting the cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since January 30, 2020. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) formulated and established laboratory surveillance for COVID-19. In this study, an analysis of the surveillance data was done to describe the testing performance and descriptive epidemiology of COVID-19 cases by time, place and person.
The data were extracted from January 22 to April 30, 2020. The frequencies of testing performance were described over time and by place. We described cases by time (epidemic curve by date of specimen collection; seven-day moving average), place (area map) and person (attack rate by age, sex and contact status), and trends were represented along with public health measures and events.
Between January 22 and April 30, 2020, a total of 1,021,518 individuals were tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Testing increased from about 250 individuals per day in the beginning of March to 50,000 specimens per day by the end of April 2020. Overall, 40,184 (3.9%) tests were reported positive. The proportion of positive cases was highest among symptomatic and asymptomatic contacts, 2-3-fold higher than among those with severe acute respiratory infection, or those with an international travel history or healthcare workers. The attack rate (per million) by age was highest among those aged 50-69 yr (63.3) and was lowest among those under 10 yr (6.1). The attack rate was higher among males (41.6) than females (24.3). The secondary attack rate was 6.0 per cent. Overall, 99.0 per cent of 736 districts reported testing and 71.1 per cent reported COVID-19 cases.
The coverage and frequency of ICMR's laboratory surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 improved over time. COVID-19 was reported from most parts of India, and the attack rate was more among men and the elderly and common among close contacts.

,"An important cause of high fertility rates in Delhi is the low availability and use of family planning services. Fostering family planning practice alleviates poverty, accelerates socioeconomic development, increases child schooling, promotes gender equality, and decreases maternal and infant mortality. The study objective was to find out the perception of potential users, health workers, and health professionals on the reasons for nonusage of contraceptive services provided and to recognize possible solutions to the identified barriers.
This cross-sectional study was done using qualitative methods among three groups of people by focus group discussion and in-depth interviews. The study was conducted in the rural health center of Madanpur Khaddar, Department of Community Medicine, Jamia Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, from June to August 2016.
The median age group of the participants was 27 years, and the participants were majorily less educated and were homemakers. Description of key thematic issues found out that contraceptive nonusage was due to lack of accessibility, lack of availability, as well as issues with privacy and autonomy. Out of 25 women, 3 had never heard the term Copper-T (CuT). Twelve out of the rest 22 women had heard about CuT, but knew no more than that.

,"Assessments of age-specific mortality and life expectancy have been done by the UN Population Division, Department of Economics and Social Affairs (UNPOP), the United States Census Bureau, WHO, and as part of previous iterations of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD). Previous iterations of the GBD used population estimates from UNPOP, which were not derived in a way that was internally consistent with the estimates of the numbers of deaths in the GBD. The present iteration of the GBD, GBD 2017, improves on previous assessments and provides timely estimates of the mortality experience of populations globally.
The GBD uses all available data to produce estimates of mortality rates between 1950 and 2017 for 23 age groups, both sexes, and 918 locations, including 195 countries and territories and subnational locations for 16 countries. Data used include vital registration systems, sample registration systems, household surveys (complete birth histories, summary birth histories, sibling histories), censuses (summary birth histories, household deaths), and Demographic Surveillance Sites. In total, this analysis used 8259 data sources. Estimates of the probability of death between birth and the age of 5 years and between ages 15 and 60 years are generated and then input into a model life table system to produce complete life tables for all locations and years. Fatal discontinuities and mortality due to HIV/AIDS are analysed separately and then incorporated into the estimation. We analyse the relationship between age-specific mortality and development status using the Socio-demographic Index, a composite measure based on fertility under the age of 25 years, education, and income. There are four main methodological improvements in GBD 2017 compared with GBD 2016: 622 additional data sources have been incorporated; new estimates of population, generated by the GBD study, are used; statistical methods used in different components of the analysis have been further standardised and improved; and the analysis has been extended backwards in time by two decades to start in 1950.
Globally, 18¬∑7% (95% uncertainty interval 18¬∑4-19¬∑0) of deaths were registered in 1950 and that proportion has been steadily increasing since, with 58¬∑8% (58¬∑2-59¬∑3) of all deaths being registered in 2015. At the global level, between 1950 and 2017, life expectancy increased from 48¬∑1 years (46¬∑5-49¬∑6) to 70¬∑5 years (70¬∑1-70¬∑8) for men and from 52¬∑9 years (51¬∑7-54¬∑0) to 75¬∑6 years (75¬∑3-75¬∑9) for women. Despite this overall progress, there remains substantial variation in life expectancy at birth in 2017, which ranges from 49¬∑1 years (46¬∑5-51¬∑7) for men in the Central African Republic to 87¬∑6 years (86¬∑9-88¬∑1) among women in Singapore. The greatest progress across age groups was for children younger than 5 years; under-5 mortality dropped from 216¬∑0 deaths (196¬∑3-238¬∑1) per 1000 livebirths in 1950 to 38¬∑9 deaths (35¬∑6-42¬∑83) per 1000 livebirths in 2017, with huge reductions across countries. Nevertheless, there were still 5¬∑4 million (5¬∑2-5¬∑6) deaths among children younger than 5 years in the world in 2017. Progress has been less pronounced and more variable for adults, especially for adult males, who had stagnant or increasing mortality rates in several countries. The gap between male and female life expectancy between 1950 and 2017, while relatively stable at the global level, shows distinctive patterns across super-regions and has consistently been the largest in central Europe, eastern Europe, and central Asia, and smallest in south Asia. Performance was also variable across countries and time in observed mortality rates compared with those expected on the basis of development.
This analysis of age-sex-specific mortality shows that there are remarkably complex patterns in population mortality across countries. The findings of this study highlight global successes, such as the large decline in under-5 mortality, which reflects significant local, national, and global commitment and investment over several decades. However, they also bring attention to mortality patterns that are a cause for concern, particularly among adult men and, to a lesser extent, women, whose mortality rates have stagnated in many countries over the time period of this study, and in some cases are increasing.

,"Early interventions benefit the mental health, academic performance and productivity of children and adolescents throughout their life. The present study¬†protocol will evaluate the effectiveness of the Elos 2.0 Programme, which is a version adapted for Brazil by the Ministry of Health, in reducing problem behaviours (e.g., disruptiveness, aggressivity and shyness) and promoting social skills in the school context in children 6 to 10 years of age. The Elos Programme is based on the Good Behaviour Game, which is widely used and prevents and/or reduces students' disruptive behaviours by establishing cooperation contingencies.
A cluster-randomized controlled trial will be performed in 30 schools in three cities (15 controls and 15 in the experimental group), with a total of 3800 children participating in the test (1900 in the control group and 1900 in the intervention group). Data will be collected by having teachers in the control and experimental classes complete the Teacher Observation of Classroom Adaptation (TOCA) questionnaire, which is an instrument used to observe children's behaviour in the classroom. We will collect data before and after the intervention period in the same year. Due to the hierarchical structure of the data, multilevel analysis will be performed to detect simultaneous differences in prevalence over time and across groups to control for sociodemographic variables.
The current study will examine the effectiveness of the Elos 2.0 Programme in reducing problem behaviours (e.g., disruptiveness, aggressivity and shyness) and promoting social skills in the school context. The findings of this school-based prevention programme for children will influence the development and implementation of similar programmes for schools and educational policymakers by identifying mechanisms that are central to achieving positive outcomes for participants.

,"Grapheme-color synesthetes experience graphemes (e.g., letters of the alphabet) as having a specific, consistent color. Most studies of grapheme-color synesthesia have only examined synesthetes in English, leaving underexplored the question of how synesthetic phenomenology might differ in languages that do not use alphabets. In particular, grapheme-color synesthesia in an abugida (a segmental writing system in which vowels are added to consonant graphemes using 'accent'-like diacritical marks) has never been studied. Here, we present a case study of a Bengali synesthete, MJ, the first report of a grapheme-color synesthete in an abugida. First, we show that for MJ, diacritics influence the overall color of the consonant grapheme they modify, 'pulling' it toward the color she experiences for the vowel. Second, we describe and analyze the complex synesthetic experiences reported by MJ for conjunct graphemes, a unique orthographic feature of Brahmi-derived scripts (such as Bengali) in which multiple graphemes are visually combined into a single 'merged' grapheme. Finally, we show that in addition to these language-specific features, MJ's synesthetic associations are influenced by some of the same linguistic properties (such as orthography and phonology) that influence synesthetic associations in other languages. We conclude that the idiosyncratic features of MJ's synesthesia reflect unique properties of the Bengali writing system, that more studies of synesthesia in non-alphabetic scripts are needed, and that synesthetic phenomenology can offer insights into how linguistic properties shape grapheme representation in the brain.",['Writing the alphabet'],"[{'lastname': 'Root', 'firstname': 'Nicholas', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of California, La Jolla, CA 92093-0109, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Bhattacharyya', 'firstname': 'Pushpita', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of California, La Jolla, CA 92093-0109, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ramachandran', 'firstname': 'Vilayanur S', 'initials': 'VS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of California, La Jolla, CA 92093-0109, USA.'}]",,,10.1163/22134808-bja10036,Multisensory research,[],,2021-03-12,33706269,,Grapheme-Color Synesthesia in an Abugida: a Bengali Case Study.,9
,"Do handwriting skills transfer when a child writes in two different scripts, such as the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets? Are our measures of handwriting skills intrinsically bound to one alphabet or will a child who faces handwriting difficulties in one script experience similar difficulties in the other script? To answer these questions, 190 children from grades 1-4 were asked to copy a short text using both the Cyrillic and Latin alphabets on a digital tablet. A recent change of policy in Kazakhstan gave us an opportunity to measure transfer, as the Latin-based Kazakh alphabet has not yet been introduced. Therefore, pupils in grade 1 had a 6-months experience in Cyrillic, and pupils in grades 2, 3, and 4 had 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 years of experience in Cyrillic, respectively. This unique situation created a quasi-experimental situation that allowed us to measure the influence of the number of years spent practicing Cyrillic on the quality of handwriting in the Latin alphabet. The results showed that some of the differences between the two scripts were constant across all grades. These differences thus reflect the intrinsic differences in the handwriting dynamics between the two alphabets. For instance, several features related to the pen pressure on the tablet are quite different. Other features, however, revealed decreasing differences between the two scripts across grades. While we found that the quality of Cyrillic writing increased from grades 1-4, due to increased practice, we also found that the quality of the Latin writing increased as well, despite the fact that all of the pupils had the same absence of experience in writing in Latin. We can therefore interpret this improvement in Latin script as an indicator of the transfer of fine motor control skills from Cyrillic to Latin. This result is especially surprising given that one could instead hypothesize a negative transfer, i.e., that the finger controls automated for one alphabet would interfere with those required by the other alphabet.

,"While the brain network supporting handwriting has previously been defined in adults, its organization in children has never been investigated. We compared the handwriting network of 23 adults and 42 children (8- to 11-year-old). Participants were instructed to write the alphabet, the days of the week, and to draw loops while being scanned. The handwriting network previously described in adults (five key regions: left dorsal premotor cortex, superior parietal lobule (SPL), fusiform and inferior frontal gyri, and right cerebellum) was also strongly activated in children. The right precentral gyrus and the right anterior cerebellum were more strongly activated in adults than in children, while the left fusiform gyrus (FuG) was more strongly activated in children than in adults. Finally, we found that, contrary to adults, children recruited prefrontal regions to complete the writing task. This constitutes the first comparative investigation of the neural correlates of writing in children and adults. Our results suggest that the network supporting handwriting is already established in middle childhood. They also highlight the major role of prefrontal regions in learning this complex skill and the importance of right precentral regions and cerebellum in the performance of automated handwriting.",['Writing the alphabet'],"[{'lastname': 'Palmis', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille Univ, CNRS, LNC, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Velay', 'firstname': 'Jean-Luc', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille Univ, CNRS, LNC, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Habib', 'firstname': 'Michel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille Univ, CNRS, LNC, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Anton', 'firstname': 'Jean-Luc', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, INT, Inst Neurosci Timone, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Nazarian', 'firstname': 'Bruno', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, INT, Inst Neurosci Timone, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Sein', 'firstname': 'Julien', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, INT, Inst Neurosci Timone, Marseille, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Longcamp', 'firstname': 'Marieke', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Aix-Marseille Univ, CNRS, LNC, Marseille, France.'}]",,¬© 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,10.1111/desc.13046,Developmental science,"['children', 'development', 'expertise', 'handwriting', 'motor learning']",,2020-10-10,33035404,,The handwriting brain in middle childhood.,9

,"Connecting with others makes people happier, but strangers in close proximity often ignore each other. Prior research (Epley & Schroeder, 2014) suggested this social disconnection stems from people misunderstanding how pleasant it would be to talk with strangers. Extending these prior results, in a field experiment with London-area train commuters, those assigned to talk with a stranger reported having a significantly more positive experience, and learning significantly more, than those assigned to a solitude or control condition. Commuters also expected a more positive experience if they talked to a stranger than in the solitude or control conditions. A second experiment explored why commuters nevertheless avoid conversation even when it is generally pleasant. Commuters predicted that trying to have a conversation would be less pleasant than actually having one because they anticipated that others would be uninterested in talking. These experiments clarify the precise aspects of social interaction that may be misunderstood. People may avoid pleasant conversations with strangers because of miscalibrated concerns about starting them.

,"Modern Next Generation- and Third Generation- Sequencing methods such as Illumina and PacBio Circular Consensus Sequencing platforms provide accurate sequencing data. Parallel developments in Deep Learning have enabled the application of Deep Neural Networks to variant calling, surpassing the accuracy of classical approaches in many settings. DeepVariant, arguably the most popular among such methods, transforms the problem of variant calling into one of image recognition where a Deep Neural Network analyzes sequencing data that is formatted as images, achieving high accuracy. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach to designing Deep Neural Networks for variant calling, where we use meticulously designed Deep Neural Network architectures and customized variant inference functions that account for the underlying nature of sequencing data instead of converting the problem to one of image recognition.
Results from 27 whole-genome variant calling experiments spanning Illumina, PacBio and hybrid Illumina-PacBio settings suggest that our method allows vastly smaller Deep Neural Networks to outperform the Inception-v3 architecture used in DeepVariant for indel and substitution-type variant calls. For example, our method reduces the number of indel call errors by up to 18%, 55% and 65% for Illumina, PacBio and hybrid Illumina-PacBio variant calling respectively, compared to a similarly trained DeepVariant pipeline. In these cases, our models are between 7 and 14 times smaller.

,"The routing algorithm is one of the main factors that directly impact on network performance. However, conventional routing algorithms do not consider the network data history, for instances, overloaded paths or equipment faults. It is expected that routing algorithms based on machine learning present advantages using that network data. Nevertheless, in a routing algorithm based on reinforcement learning (RL) technique, additional control message headers could be required. In this context, this research presents an enhanced routing protocol based on RL, named e-RLRP, in which the overhead is reduced. Specifically, a dynamic adjustment in the Hello message interval is implemented to compensate the overhead generated by the use of RL. Different network scenarios with variable number of nodes, routes, traffic flows and degree of mobility are implemented, in which network parameters, such as packet loss, delay, throughput and overhead are obtained. Additionally, a Voice-over-IP (VoIP) communication scenario is implemented, in which the E-model algorithm is used to predict the communication quality. For performance comparison, the OLSR, BATMAN and RLRP protocols are used. Experimental results show that the e-RLRP reduces network overhead compared to RLRP, and overcomes in most cases all of these protocols, considering both network parameters and VoIP quality.",['Hello English: Learn English'],"[{'lastname': 'Militani', 'firstname': 'Davi Ribeiro', 'initials': 'DR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Computer Science, Federal University of Lavras, Minas Gerais 37200-000, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'de Moraes', 'firstname': 'Hermes Pimenta', 'initials': 'HP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Computer Science, Federal University of Lavras, Minas Gerais 37200-000, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Rosa', 'firstname': 'Renata Lopes', 'initials': 'RL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Computer Science, Federal University of Lavras, Minas Gerais 37200-000, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Wuttisittikulkij', 'firstname': 'Lunchakorn', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Wireless Communication Ecosystem Research Unit, Department of Electrical Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok 10330, Thailand.'}, {'lastname': 'Ram√≠rez', 'firstname': 'Miguel Arjona', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Electronic Systems Engineering, University of S√£o Paulo, S√£o Paulo 01000-000, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Rodr√≠guez', 'firstname': 'Dem√≥stenes Zegarra', 'initials': 'DZ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Computer Science, Federal University of Lavras, Minas Gerais 37200-000, Brazil.'}]",,,10.3390/s21020504,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","['QoE', 'VoIP', 'intelligent routing', 'machine learning', 'reinforcement learning', 'routing algorithms']",,2021-01-16,33445691,,Enhanced Routing Algorithm Based on Reinforcement Machine Learning-A Case of VoIP Service.,10
,"Storyboards are a series of thumbnail images that act as a planning document for your overall animation project. Each thumbnail image is part of what is known as a shot, and shots are strung together to create scenes, which in turn create a whole animation. Medical animations, compared to film or animated movies, have rigid and specific requirements; however, by utilizing storyboards as a planning document we can infuse our medical animations with emotion, life, and beauty. This chapter will review common storyboarding fundamentals, like camera moves and editing techniques, and how they may be applied to the medical world. Camera moves are important to string shots together and can help add emphasis to specific sections. Zooms and pans are used extensively within medical animation and it is important to note which circumstance might call for either one. Zooms are great for moving to a drastically different microscopic magnification. Pans create visual interest for a stepwise reaction. Techniques such as lighting, depth, and insets and labels create a more balanced composition and save time in the production phase.

,"In recent years, the popularity of tablets has skyrocketed and there has been an explosive growth in apps designed for children. Howhever, many of these apps are released without tests for their effectiveness. This is worrying given that the factors influencing children's learning from touchscreen devices need to be examined in detail. In particular, it has been suggested that children learn less from passive video viewing relative to equivalent live interaction, which would have implications for learning from such digital tools. However, this so-called video deficit may be reduced by allowing children greater influence over their learning environment. Across two touchscreen-based experiments, we examined whether 2- to 4-year-olds benefit from actively choosing what to learn more about in a digital word learning task. We designed a tablet study in which ""active"" participants were allowed to choose which objects they were taught the label of, while yoked ""passive"" participants were presented with the objects chosen by their active peers. We then examined recognition of the learned associations across different tasks. In Experiment 1, children in the passive condition outperformed those in the active condition (n = 130). While Experiment 2 replicated these findings in a new group of Malay-speaking children (n = 32), there were no differences in children's learning or recognition of the novel word-object associations using a more implicit looking time measure. These results suggest that there may be performance costs associated with active tasks designed as in the current study, and at the very least, there may not always be systematic benefits associated with active learning in touchscreen-based word learning tasks. The current studies add to the evidence that educational apps need to be evaluated before release: While children might benefit from interactive apps under certain conditions, task design and requirements need to consider factors that may detract from successful performance.",['Baby Games for 1+ Toddlers'],"[{'lastname': 'Ackermann', 'firstname': 'Lena', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Psychology of Language Department, University of G√∂ttingen, G√∂ttingen, Germany.\nLeibniz Science Campus ""Primate Cognition"", G√∂ttingen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Lo', 'firstname': 'Chang Huan', 'initials': 'CH', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, University of Nottingham Malaysia, Semenyih, Malaysia.'}, {'lastname': 'Mani', 'firstname': 'Nivedita', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Psychology of Language Department, University of G√∂ttingen, G√∂ttingen, Germany.\nLeibniz Science Campus ""Primate Cognition"", G√∂ttingen, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Mayor', 'firstname': 'Julien', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.'}]",,,10.1371/journal.pone.0240519,PloS one,[],,2020-12-02,33259476,,Word learning from a tablet app: Toddlers perform better in a passive context.,16
,"Parents may use screen exposure or screen exposure combined with feeding for infants and toddlers to alleviate their own stress.
To evaluate the association of individual and contextual stressors with child screen exposure (CSE) and CSE combined with feeding (CSE+F) in children aged 7 to 18 months as measured by parent-reported use and variation in quantity of CSE and CSE+F.
This cross-sectional, population-based study drew parent-child participants from TARGet Kids, a network of primary health care research settings throughout Toronto, Ontario, Canada, between November 1, 2011, and July 31, 2018. The included children were aged 7 to 18 months. Exclusion criteria were health conditions affecting growth, acute conditions, chronic conditions, severe developmental delay, and families who were unable to communicate in the English language. Data were analyzed from April 1, 2019, to July 31, 2019.
Parenting stress, child age, child negative affectivity, family living arrangements, and family income were assessed with parent-completed questionnaires.
The primary outcome was CSE and the variation in CSE, which represented the amount of background and engaged use of screens (television, videos or DVDs, video games, computers, and mobile devices) in a typical week. The secondary outcome was CSE+F, which represented the frequency of breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack consumption during screen exposure in a typical week. Both CSE and CSE+F were assessed with the parent-completed Nutrition and Health Questionnaire; Infant Behavior Questionnaire, Revised Very Short; and Parenting Stress Index, Short Form.
The final sample size was 1085 children for the analysis of CSE and‚Äâ1083 children for the analysis of CSE+F. Among 914 respondents, the children's mean (SD) age was 11.6 (2.3) months, and 478 (52.3%) were male. Among 910 respondents, 839 (92.2%) were mothers, with a mean (SD) age among 873 respondents of 34.4 (4.2) years. In a typical week, 581 of 779 children (74.6%) were reported to have any CSE, and 321 of 874 children (36.7%) had some CSE+F. Higher parenting stress levels (odds ratio [OR],‚Äâ1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.04) and older child age (OR,‚Äâ1.43; 95% CI, 1.01-2.03; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.04) were associated with CSE. Higher parenting stress levels (incidence rate [IR],‚Äâ1.00; 95% CI, 1.00-1.01; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.002) and lower household income (IR,‚Äâ1.26; 95% CI, 1.10-1.45; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.01) were associated with increased CSE.

Lower household income (IR,‚Äâ1.21; 95% CI, 1.03-1.42; P‚Äâ=‚Äâ.02) was associated with increased CSE+F.

Parents reported their children's screen time (television/video, video/computer games) at all three time-points. Parents also reported on children's social skills using the Adaptive Social Behavior Inventory (ASBI) at time-points 2 and 3, and comply (e.g., cooperates; 10 items), express (e.g., joins play; 13 items), and disrupt (e.g., teases; 7 items) subscales were created by summing items. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were conducted to address objective one.

,"Determining the most important demographic correlates of sedentary behavior and physical activity will help identify the groups of children that are most in need of intervention. Little is known in regards to the demographic correlates of sedentary behavior and physical activity in toddlers (aged 12-35 months), where long-term behavioral patterns may initially be formed. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the associations between demographic correlates and specific types of sedentary behavior and physical activity in this age group.
Findings are based on 149 toddlers (19.0‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ1.9¬†months) and their parents (33.7‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ4.7¬†years) recruited from immunization clinics in Edmonton, Canada as part of the Parents' Role in Establishing healthy Physical activity and Sedentary behavior habits (PREPS) project. Toddlers' and parental demographic characteristics and toddlers' television viewing, video/computer games, and overall screen time were measured via the PREPS parental questionnaire. Toddlers' objectively measured sedentary time and physical activity (light, moderate to vigorous, and total) were accelerometer-derived using Actigraph wGT3X-BT monitors. Simple and multiple linear regression models were conducted to examine associations.
In the multiple linear regression models, toddlers' age, toddlers' sex (female versus male), toddlers' race/ethnicity (other versus European-Canadian/Caucasian), and household income ($50,001 to $100,000 versus‚Äâ>‚Äâ$100,000) were significantly positively associated, and main type of child care (child care center versus parental care) was significantly negatively associated with screen time. Similar findings were observed with television viewing, except null associations were observed for toddlers' sex. Toddlers' race/ethnicity (other versus European-Canadian/Caucasian) was significantly positively associated and main type of child care (child care center, day home, other versus parental care) was significantly negatively associated with video/computer games. Toddlers' sex (female versus male) was significantly positively associated with sedentary time and significantly negatively associated with moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity.
Female toddlers, toddlers from ethnic minority groups, toddlers from families of lower income, and toddlers whose main type of child care is not center-based may be important targets for screen time interventions in toddlers. Apart from sex, demographic correlates may not be important targets for objectively measured sedentary time and physical activity in toddlers.",['Baby Games for 1+ Toddlers'],"[{'lastname': 'Carson', 'firstname': 'Valerie', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2H9, Canada. vlcarson@ualberta.ca.'}, {'lastname': 'Kuzik', 'firstname': 'Nicholas', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, T6G 2H9, Canada.'}]",,,10.1186/s12889-017-4125-y,BMC public health,"['Accelerometer', 'Correlates', 'Physical activity', 'Screen time', 'Sedentary behavior', 'Toddlers']",,2017-02-15,28193271,"In the multiple linear regression models, toddlers' age, toddlers' sex (female versus male), toddlers' race/ethnicity (other versus European-Canadian/Caucasian), and household income ($50,001 to $100,000 versus‚Äâ>‚Äâ$100,000) were significantly positively associated, and main type of child care (child care center versus parental care) was significantly negatively associated with screen time.

,"Adults with Down Syndrome (DS) are at higher risk for severe outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) than the general population, but evidence is required to understand the risks for children with DS, which is necessary to inform COVID-19 shielding advice and vaccination priorities. We aimed to determine the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in children with DS. Using data from an international survey obtained from a range of countries and control data from the United States, we compared the prevalence of symptoms and medical complications and risk factors for severe outcomes between DS and non-DS paediatric populations with COVID-19. Hospitalised COVID-19 patients <18 years with DS had a higher incidence of respiratory symptoms, fever, and several medical complications from COVID-19 than control patients without DS <18 years. Older age, obesity, and epilepsy were significant risk factors for hospitalisation among paediatric COVID-19 patients with DS, and age and thyroid disorder were significant risk factors for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Mortality rates were low in all paediatric COVID-19 patients (with and without DS), contrasting with previous findings in adults with DS (who exhibit higher mortality than those without DS). Children with DS are at increased risk for more severe presentations of COVID-19. Efforts should be made to ensure the comprehensive and early detection of COVID-19 in this population and to identify children with DS who present comorbidities that pose a risk for a severe course of COVID-19. Our results emphasize the importance of vaccinating children with DS as soon as they become eligible.",['Kid-E-Cats Playhouse'],"[{'lastname': 'Emes', 'firstname': 'David', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Faculty of Epidemiology and Public Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London WC1E 7HT, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'H√ºls', 'firstname': 'Anke', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.\nGangarosa Department of Environmental Health, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Baumer', 'firstname': 'Nicole', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': ""Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Dierssen', 'firstname': 'Mara', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, 08003 Barcelona, Spain.\nUniversitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF), 08002 Barcelona, Spain.\nCentro de Investigaci√≥n Biom√©dica en Red de Enfermedades Raras (CIBERER), 28029 Madrid, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Puri', 'firstname': 'Shiela', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Down Syndrome Medical Interest Group UK, Leeds Community Healthcare NHS Trust, Teddington TW11 9PS, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Russell', 'firstname': 'Lauren', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sherman', 'firstname': 'Stephanie L', 'initials': 'SL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Human Genetics, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Strydom', 'firstname': 'Andre', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London, London WC2R 2LS, UK.\nThe London Down Syndrome (LonDownS) Consortium, London WC2R 2LS, UK.\nSouth London and the Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London WC2R 2LS, UK.""}, {'lastname': 'Bargagna', 'firstname': 'Stefania', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Developmental Neuroscience, IRCCS Fondazione Stella Maris, 56128 Pisa, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Brand√£o', 'firstname': 'Ana Cl√°udia', 'initials': 'AC', 'affiliation': 'Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, ACB, Sao Paulo 05652-900, SP, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Costa', 'firstname': 'Alberto C S', 'initials': 'ACS', 'affiliation': 'Departments of Pediatrics and of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, ACSC, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Feany', 'firstname': 'Patrick T', 'initials': 'PT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology, Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chicoine', 'firstname': 'Brian Allen', 'initials': 'BA', 'affiliation': 'Advocate Medical Group, Adult Down Syndrome Center, Park Ridge, IL 60068, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ghosh', 'firstname': 'Sujay', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Cytogenetics and Genomics Research Unit, Department of Zoology, University of Calcutta, Kolkata 700 073, West Bengal, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Rebillat', 'firstname': 'Anne-Sophie', 'initials': 'AS', 'affiliation': 'Institut J√©r√¥me Lejeune, 75015 Paris, France.'}, {'lastname': 'Sgandurra', 'firstname': 'Giuseppina', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Developmental Neuroscience, IRCCS Fondazione Stella Maris, 56128 Pisa, Italy.\nDepartment of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, 56126 Pisa, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Valentini', 'firstname': 'Diletta', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Pediatric Unit, Bambino Ges√π Children's Hospital, IRCCS, 00146 Rome, Italy.""}, {'lastname': 'Rohrer', 'firstname': 'Tilman R', 'initials': 'TR', 'affiliation': 'Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, Saarland University Medical Center, 66421 Homburg/Saar, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Levin', 'firstname': 'Johannes', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t M√ºnchen, 80539 Munich, Germany.\nGerman Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Site Munich, 81377 Munich, Germany.\nMunich Cluster for Systems Neurology (SyNergy), 81377 Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Lakhanpaul', 'firstname': 'Monica', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Population, Policy and Practice Department, Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, UCL, London WC1N 1EH, UK.\nWhittington NHS Trust, London N19 5NF, UK.\nDown Syndrome Medical Interest Group, Teddington TW11 9PS, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'On Behalf Of The Trisomy Research Society Covid-Initiative Study Group', 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.3390/jcm10215125,Journal of clinical medicine,"['COVID-19', 'Down Syndrome', 'paediatrics']",,2021-11-14,34768645,,COVID-19 in Children with Down Syndrome: Data from the Trisomy 21 Research Society Survey.,16
,"(1) Background: It has been identified that schools that adopt at least two hours a week of physical education and plan specific contents and activities can achieve development goals related to physical level, such as promoting health, well-being, and healthy lifestyles, on a personal level, including bodily awareness and confidence in physical skills, as well as a general sense of well-being, greater security and self-esteem, sense of responsibility, patience, courage, and mental balance. The purpose of this study was to establish the effect of physical education programs on the physical activity and emotional well-being of primary school children. (2) Methods: The experimental group comprised 45 girls and 44 boys aged 6-7 years (First Grade) and 48 girls and 46 boys aged 8-9 years (Second Grade), while the control group comprised 43 girls and 46 boys aged 6-7 years (First Grade) and 47 girls and 45 boys aged 8-9 years (Second Grade). All children attended the same school. The Children's Physical Activity Questionnaire was used, which is based on the Children's Leisure Activities Study Survey questionnaire, which includes activities specific to young children (e.g., ""playing in a playhouse""). Emotional well-being status was explored by estimating three main dimensions: somatic anxiety, personality anxiety, and social anxiety. The Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS) was used. (3) Results: When analysing the pre-test results of physical activity of the 6-7- and 8-9-year-old children, it turned out that both the First Grade (92.15 MET, min/week) and Second Grade (97.50 MET, min/week) participants in the experimental group were physically active during physical education lessons. When exploring the results of somatic anxiety in EG (4.95 ¬± 1.10 points), both before and after the experiment, we established that somatic anxiety in EG was 4.55 ¬± 1.00 points after the intervention program, demonstrating lower levels of depression, seclusion, somatic complaints, aggression, and delinquent behaviours (F = 4.785, ",['Kid-E-Cats Playhouse'],"[{'lastname': 'Kliziene', 'firstname': 'Irina', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Educational Research Group, Institute of Social Science and Humanity, Kaunas University of Technology, Kaunas 44249, Lithuania.'}, {'lastname': 'Cizauskas', 'firstname': 'Ginas', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Design, Kaunas University of Technology, Kaunas 51424, Lithuania.'}, {'lastname': 'Sipaviciene', 'firstname': 'Saule', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Applied Biology and Rehabilitation, Lithuanian Sports University, Kaunas 44221, Lithuania.'}, {'lastname': 'Aleksandraviciene', 'firstname': 'Roma', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Coaching Science, Lithuanian Sports University, Kaunas 44221, Lithuania.\nSports Centre, Vytautas Magnus University, Kaunas 51211, Lithuania.'}, {'lastname': 'Zaicenkoviene', 'firstname': 'Kristina', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Coaching Science, Lithuanian Sports University, Kaunas 44221, Lithuania.'}]",,,10.3390/ijerph18147536,International journal of environmental research and public health,"['anxiety', 'physical activity', 'physical educational program', 'primary education']",,2021-07-25,34299987,,Effects of a Physical Education Program on Physical Activity and Emotional Well-Being among Primary School Children.,16

The T21RS COVID-19 Initiative launched an international survey for clinicians or caregivers/family members on patients with COVID-19 and DS (N=1046). De-identified survey data collected between April and October 2020 were analysed and compared with the UK ISARIC4C survey of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with and without DS. COVID-19 patients with DS from the ISARIC4C survey (ISARIC4C DS cases=100) were matched to a random set of patients without DS (ISARIC4C controls=400) and hospitalized DS cases in the T21RS survey (T21RS DS cases=100) based on age, gender, and ethnicity.
The mean age in the T21RS survey was 29 years (SD=18), 73% lived with their family. Similar to the general population, the most frequent signs and symptoms of COVID-19 were fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Pain and nausea were reported less frequently (p<0.01), whereas altered consciousness/confusion were reported more frequently (p<0.01). Risk factors for hospitalization and mortality were similar to the general population (age, male gender, diabetes, obesity, dementia) with the addition of congenital heart defects as a risk factor for hospitalization. Mortality rates showed a rapid increase from age 40 and were higher than for controls (T21RS DS versus controls: risk ratio (RR)=3.5 (95%-CI=2.6;4.4), ISARIC4C DS versus controls: RR=2.9 (95%-CI=2.1;3.8)) even after adjusting for known risk factors for COVID-19 mortality.

,"This research explores how e-health systems' features (information quality, quality of the system, usability perceived, and perceived usefulness) contribute to improving medical personnel performance in medical centers, patient care, and physician-patient interactions in Jordan. The objective is to evaluate a single integrated model consisting of the technology acceptance model. This study used the logical research method and approach. A collection of data from 212 medical personnel working in 19 healthcare facilities throughout Jordan were gathered. To analyze the data collected and test the hypotheses of the research, a partially square/structural equation modeling method has been employed. The study found that the health information system (HIS) information quality has a direct and indirect beneficial effect on the performance of the staff, beneficial effects on patient care alone, and only favorable, indirect effects on the doctor-patient relationship. On the contrary, system quality was shown to influence directly and indirectly and to have a direct and indirect beneficial effect both on the connection between doctors and patients. Remember that the HIS has accessibility, speed, and mistake detection and avoids error issues. These shortcomings are suggested to be rectified in conjunction with improved user perception towards easy usage and utilization of the system.",['Princess Computer'],"[{'lastname': 'Alazzam', 'firstname': 'Malik Bader', 'initials': 'MB', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Computer Science and Informatics, Amman Arab University, Amman, Jordan.'}, {'lastname': 'Al Khatib', 'firstname': 'Husam', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Al-Ahliyya Amman University, Amman, Jordan.'}, {'lastname': 'Mohammad', 'firstname': 'Walid Theib', 'initials': 'WT', 'affiliation': ""Assistant Professor Organization Al-Hussein Bin Talal University, Princess Aisha Bint Al-Hussein Faculty of Nursing, Princess Aisha Nursing College Ma'an, Ma'an, Jordan.""}, {'lastname': 'Alassery', 'firstname': 'Fawaz', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Computer Engineering, College of Computers and Information Technology, Taif University, Taif, Saudi Arabia.'}]",,Copyright ¬© 2021 Malik Bader Alazzam et al.,10.1155/2021/5887911,Journal of healthcare engineering,[],,2021-12-07,34868523,,"E-Health System Characteristics, Medical Performance, and Healthcare Quality at Jordan's Health Centers.",10

,"A randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre study with health economic and nested qualitative studies to determine if mifepristone (Mifegyne
Women diagnosed with missed miscarriage in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy were randomly assigned (1‚Äâ:‚Äâ1 ratio) to receive 200‚Äâmg of oral mifepristone or matched placebo, followed by 800‚ÄâŒºg of misoprostol 2 days later. A web-based randomisation system allocated the women to the two groups, with minimisation for age, body mass index, parity, gestational age, amount of bleeding and randomising centre. The primary outcome was failure to pass the gestational sac within 7 days after randomisation. The prespecified key secondary outcome was requirement for surgery to resolve the miscarriage. A within-trial cost-effectiveness study and a nested qualitative study were also conducted. Women who completed the trial protocol were purposively approached to take part in an interview to explore their satisfaction with and the acceptability of medical management of missed miscarriage.
A total of 711 women, from 28 hospitals in the UK, were randomised to receive either mifepristone plus misoprostol (357 women) or placebo plus misoprostol (354 women). The follow-up rate for the primary outcome was 98% (696 out of 711 women). The risk of failure to pass the gestational sac within 7 days was 17% (59 out of 348 women) in the mifepristone plus misoprostol group, compared with 24% (82 out of 348 women) in the placebo plus misoprostol group (risk ratio 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.54 to 0.98; 
The results from this trial are not generalisable to women diagnosed with incomplete miscarriage and the study does not allow for a comparison with expectant or surgical management of miscarriage.
Future work should use existing data to assess and rank the relative clinical effectiveness and safety profiles for all methods of management of miscarriage.
Our trial showed that pre-treatment with mifepristone followed by misoprostol resulted in a higher rate of resolution of missed miscarriage than misoprostol treatment alone. Women were largely satisfied with medical management of missed miscarriage and would choose it again. The mifepristone and misoprostol intervention was shown to be cost-effective in comparison to misoprostol alone.

Miscarriage is a common complication of pregnancy, affecting approximately one in four women. Sometimes, medical treatment (i.e. tablets) may be offered to start or speed up the miscarriage process in order for the womb to empty itself. A drug called misoprostol (a tablet that makes the womb contract) is currently recommended for this treatment. However, the addition of another drug called mifepristone [a tablet that reduces pregnancy hormones (Mifegyne",['Princess Computer'],"[{'lastname': 'Devall', 'firstname': 'Adam', 'initials': 'A',

,"Preterm birth is associated with increased risk of neurological impairment and deficits in cognition, motor function, and behavioral problems. Limited studies indicate that multi-sensory experiences support brain development in preterm infants. Music appears to promote neurobiological processes and neuronal learning in the human brain. Creative music therapy (CMT) is an individualized, interactive therapeutic approach based on the theory and methods of Nordoff and Robbins. CMT may promote brain development in preterm infants via concurrent interaction and meaningful auditory stimulation. We hypothesize that preterm infants who receive creative music therapy during neonatal intensive care admission will have developmental benefits short- and long-term brain function.
A prospective, randomized controlled single-center pilot trial involving 60 clinically stable preterm infants under 32¬†weeks of gestational age is conducted in preparation for a multi-center trial. Thirty infants each are randomized to either standard neonatal intensive care or standard care with CMT. Music therapy intervention is approximately 20¬†min in duration three times per week. A trained music therapist sings for the infants in lullaby style, individually entrained and adjusted to the infant's rhythm and affect. Primary objectives of this study are feasibility of protocol implementation and investigating the potential mechanism of efficacy for this new intervention. To examine the effect of this new intervention, non-invasive, quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods at corrected age and standardized neurodevelopmental assessments using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development third edition at a corrected age of 24¬†months and Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children at 5¬†years will be performed. All assessments will be performed and analyzed by blinded experts.
To our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled clinical trial to systematically examine possible effects of creative music therapy on short- and long-term brain development in preterm infants. This project lies at the interface of music therapy, neuroscience, and medical imaging. New insights into the potential role and impact of music on brain function and development may be elucidated. If such a low-cost, low-risk intervention is demonstrated in a future multi-center trial to be effective in supporting brain development in preterm neonates, findings could have broad clinical implications for this vulnerable patient population.

,"Touchscreen technologies provide an intuitive and attractive source of sensory/cognitive stimulation for young children. Despite fears that usage may have a negative impact on toddlers' cognitive development, empirical evidence is lacking. The current study presents results from the UK Toddler Attentional Behaviours and LEarning with Touchscreens (TABLET) project, examining the association between toddlers' touchscreen use and the attainment of developmental milestones. Data were gathered in an online survey of 715 parents of 6- to 36-month-olds to address two research questions: (1) How does touchscreen use change from 6 to 36 months? (2) In toddlers (19-36 months, i.e., above the median age, n = 366), how does retrospectively reported age of first touchscreen usage relate to gross motor (i.e., walking), fine motor (i.e., stacking blocks), and language (i.e., producing two-word utterances) milestones? In our sample, the proportion of children using touchscreens, as well as the average daily usage time, increased with age (youngest quartile, 6-11 months: 51.22% users, 8.53 min per day; oldest quartile, 26-36 months: 92.05% users, average use of 43.95 min per day). In toddlers, aged 19-36 months, age of first touchscreen use was significantly associated with fine motor (stacking blocks), p = 0.03, after controlling for covariates age, sex, mother's education (a proxy for socioeconomic status) as well as age of early fine motor milestone achievement (pincer grip). This effect was only present for active scrolling of the touchscreen p = 0.04, not for video watching. No significant relationships were found between touchscreen use and either gross motor or language milestones. Touchscreen use increases rapidly over the first 3 years of life. In the current study, we find no evidence to support a negative association between the age of first touchscreen usage and developmental milestones. Indeed, earlier touchscreen use, specifically scrolling of the screen, was associated with earlier fine motor achievement. Future longitudinal studies are required to elucidate the temporal order and mechanisms of this association, and to examine the impact of touchscreen use on other, more fine-grained, measures of behavioral, cognitive, and neural development.

,"A head camera was used to examine the visual correlates of object name learning by toddlers as they played with novel objects and as the parent spontaneously named those objects. The toddlers' learning of the object names was tested after play, and the visual properties of the head camera images during naming events associated with learned and unlearned object names were analyzed. Naming events associated with learning had a clear visual signature, one in which the visual information itself was clean and visual competition among objects was minimized. Moreover, for learned object names, the visual advantage of the named target over competitors was sustained, both before and after the heard name. The findings are discussed in terms of the visual and cognitive processes that may depend on clean sensory input for learning and also on the sensory-motor, cognitive, and social processes that may create these optimal visual moments for learning.

,"Sensory over-responsivity (SOR) affects many individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), often leading to stressful encounters during daily routines.
This study describes the associations between early SOR symptoms and the longitudinal course of restrictions in family life activities and parenting stress across three time-points in families raising a child with ASD (n = 174). Covariates were child diagnostic severity, emotional problems, and maternal affective symptoms. At time 1 mean chronological age was 28.5 months. Children were administered the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL). Parents completed the Infant Toddler Sensory Profile (ITSP), Infant-Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (ITSEA), Beck Anxiety Index (BAI), and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Inventory (CES-D) at time 1; and the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) and Family Life Impairment Scale (FLIS) at the three annual time-points.
Latent Growth Curve Models indicated that higher SOR scores on the ITSP at time 1 were associated with higher initial levels of family life impairment and parenting stress and with a smaller magnitude of change over time. These associations were independent of severity of ADOS social-communication symptoms, MSEL composite score, ITSEA externalizing and anxiety symptoms, and maternal affective symptoms as measured by the BAI and CES-D. On average FLIS and PSI did not change over time, however, there was significant individual variability.

,"Detecting early pathological cognitive decline is critical for dementia and aging-related research and clinical diagnostics. Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) is commonly used to measure episodic verbal memory. The test requires participants to learn a list of 15 words over several trials. Since multiple testing is often required to detect cognitive decline, but repeating the same test can bias results, we developed 10 German AVLT word lists.
We randomly assigned the lists to 4,000 participants (aged 30-94¬†years) from a population-based cohort to test their comparability, as well as aging effects and sex differences.
Nine lists were highly comparable, with only one being slightly more difficult. Recall performance decreased on average by 0.6-1.1 words per trial per decade of age. Perseveration errors decreased with increasing age. Women remembered on average between 0.8 and 1.5 words per trial more than men, regardless of age. Women also outperformed men in the sum of Trials 1-5, learning over trials, retroactive inhibition, and false-positive and interference errors. Proactive inhibition remained stable across age and was unaffected by sex.

,"To acquire language, infants must learn to segment words from running speech. A significant body of experimental research shows that infants use multiple cues to do so; however, little research has comprehensively examined the distribution of such cues in naturalistic speech. We conducted a comprehensive corpus analysis of German child-directed speech (CDS) using data from the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES) database, investigating the availability of word stress, transitional probabilities (TPs), and lexical and sublexical frequencies as potential cues for word segmentation. Seven hours of data (~15,000 words) were coded, representing around an average day of speech to infants. The analysis revealed that for 97% of words, primary stress was carried by the initial syllable, implicating stress as a reliable cue to word onset in German CDS. Word identity was also marked by TPs between syllables, which were higher within than between words, and higher for backwards than forwards transitions. Words followed a Zipfian-like frequency distribution, and over two-thirds of words (78%) were monosyllabic. Of the 50 most frequent words, 82% were function words, which accounted for 47% of word tokens in the entire corpus. Finally, 15% of all utterances comprised single words. These results give rich novel insights into the availability of segmentation cues in German CDS, and support the possibility that infants draw on multiple converging cues to segment their input. The data, which we make openly available to the research community, will help guide future experimental investigations on this topic.","['Learn German - 15,000 Words']","[{'lastname': 'St√§rk', 'firstname': 'Katja', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Language Development Department, Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Kidd', 'firstname': 'Evan', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Language Development Department, Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, The Netherlands.\nResearch School of Psychology, The Australian National University, Australia.\nARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Frost', 'firstname': 'Rebecca L A', 'initials': 'RLA', 'affiliation': 'Language Development Department, Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, The Netherlands.'}]",,,10.1177/0023830920979016,Language and speech,"['German', 'Language acquisition', 'child-directed speech', 'distributional cues', 'speech segmentation']",,2021-02-02,33517856,,Word Segmentation Cues in German Child-Directed Speech: A Corpus Analysis.,15
,"Automatic speech recognition systems are already being used in spheres employing a restricted vocabulary.

To this end 34 representative pages of text (a total of 11,000 words) taken from expertises on cases of suspected medical malpractice (many different subspecialties) were dictated using IBM's ""Voice Type Simply Speaking"" software. Having completed a page, the resulting error rate was recorded, and the text was corrected before we proceeded with the dictation. Finally, 3 pages of text were re-dictated and the resulting error rate determined.
The error rate in the previously unknown text ranged between 10 and 23 per cent (mean 15.9%) without any significant reduction during the training phase, while that in the re-dictated text was drastically reduced to less than 3 per cent. It became evident that once a word was corrected the system hardly ever repeated that particular mistake.
The system's poor performance on unknown text and the missing reduction in the error rate during the training phase are obviously not due to any incompetence of the system but to the huge amount of technical jargon in the scope of medical writing.

,"SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with an increased rate of venous thromboembolism in critically ill patients. Since surgical patients are already at higher risk of venous thromboembolism than general populations, this study aimed to determine if patients with peri-operative or prior SARS-CoV-2 were at further increased risk of venous thromboembolism. We conducted a planned sub-study and analysis from an international, multicentre, prospective cohort study of elective and emergency patients undergoing surgery during October 2020. Patients from all surgical specialties were included. The primary outcome measure was venous thromboembolism (pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis) within 30‚Äâdays of surgery. SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis was defined as peri-operative (7‚Äâdays before to 30‚Äâdays after surgery); recent (1-6‚Äâweeks before surgery); previous (‚â•7‚Äâweeks before surgery); or none. Information on prophylaxis regimens or pre-operative anti-coagulation for baseline comorbidities was not available. Postoperative venous thromboembolism rate was 0.5% (666/123,591) in patients without SARS-CoV-2; 2.2% (50/2317) in patients with peri-operative SARS-CoV-2; 1.6% (15/953) in patients with recent SARS-CoV-2; and 1.0% (11/1148) in patients with previous SARS-CoV-2. After adjustment for confounding factors, patients with peri-operative (adjusted odds ratio 1.5 (95%CI 1.1-2.0)) and recent SARS-CoV-2 (1.9 (95%CI 1.2-3.3)) remained at higher risk of venous thromboembolism, with a borderline finding in previous SARS-CoV-2 (1.7 (95%CI 0.9-3.0)). Overall, venous thromboembolism was independently associated with 30-day mortality (5.4 (95%CI 4.3-6.7)). In patients with SARS-CoV-2, mortality without venous thromboembolism was 7.4% (319/4342) and with venous thromboembolism was 40.8% (31/76).

Isolation was defined as the period before surgery during which patients did not leave their house or receive visitors from outside their household. The primary outcome was postoperative pulmonary complications, adjusted in multivariable models for measured confounders. Pre-defined sub-group analyses were performed for the primary outcome. A total of 96,454 patients from 114 countries were included and overall, 26,948 (27.9%) patients isolated before surgery. Postoperative pulmonary complications were recorded in 1947 (2.0%) patients of which 227 (11.7%) were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Patients who isolated pre-operatively were older, had more respiratory comorbidities and were more commonly from areas of high SARS-CoV-2 incidence and high-income countries. Although the overall rates of postoperative pulmonary complications were similar in those that isolated and those that did not (2.1% vs 2.0%, respectively), isolation was associated with higher rates of postoperative pulmonary complications after adjustment (adjusted OR 1.20, 95%CI 1.05-1.36, p¬†=¬†0.005). Sensitivity analyses revealed no further differences when patients were categorised by: pre-operative testing; use of COVID-19-free pathways; or community SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. The rate of postoperative pulmonary complications increased with periods of isolation longer than 3¬†days, with an OR (95%CI) at 4-7¬†days or ‚â•¬†8¬†days of 1.25 (1.04-1.48), p¬†=¬†0.015 and 1.31 (1.11-1.55), p¬†=¬†0.001, respectively. Isolation before elective surgery might be associated with a small but clinically important increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. Longer periods of isolation showed no reduction in the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. These findings have significant implications for global provision of elective surgical care.",['Little Panda Policeman'],"[{'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': 'University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,¬© 2021 Association of Anaesthetists.,10.1111/anae.15560,Anaesthesia,"['COVID-19', 'SARS-Cov-2', 'pathways', 'pre-operative isolation', 'surgery']",,2021-08-10,34371522,,Effects of pre-operative isolation on postoperative pulmonary complications after elective surgery: an international prospective cohort study.,15
,"Preoperative SARS-CoV-2 vaccination could support safer elective surgery. Vaccine numbers are limited so this study aimed to inform their prioritization by modelling.
The primary outcome was the number needed to vaccinate (NNV) to prevent one COVID-19-related death in 1 year. NNVs were based on postoperative SARS-CoV-2 rates and mortality in an international cohort study (surgical patients), and community SARS-CoV-2 incidence and case fatality data (general population). NNV estimates were stratified by age (18-49, 50-69, 70 or more years) and type of surgery. Best- and worst-case scenarios were used to describe uncertainty.
NNVs were more favourable in surgical patients than the general population. The most favourable NNVs were in patients aged 70 years or more needing cancer surgery (351; best case 196, worst case 816) or non-cancer surgery (733; best case 407, worst case 1664). Both exceeded the NNV in the general population (1840; best case 1196, worst case 3066). NNVs for surgical patients remained favourable at a range of SARS-CoV-2 incidence rates in sensitivity analysis modelling. Globally, prioritizing preoperative vaccination of patients needing elective surgery ahead of the general population could prevent an additional 58 687 (best case 115 007, worst case 20 177) COVID-19-related deaths in 1 year.

,"Peri-operative SARS-CoV-2 infection increases postoperative mortality. The aim of this study was to determine the optimal duration of planned delay before surgery in patients who have had SARS-CoV-2 infection. This international, multicentre, prospective cohort study included patients undergoing elective or emergency surgery during October 2020. Surgical patients with pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 infection were compared with those without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary outcome measure was 30-day postoperative mortality. Logistic regression models were used to calculate adjusted 30-day mortality rates stratified by time from diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection to surgery. Among 140,231 patients (116 countries), 3127 patients (2.2%) had a pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Adjusted 30-day mortality in patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection was 1.5% (95%CI 1.4-1.5). In patients with a pre-operative SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, mortality was increased in patients having surgery within 0-2¬†weeks, 3-4¬†weeks and 5-6¬†weeks of the diagnosis (odds ratio (95%CI) 4.1 (3.3-4.8), 3.9 (2.6-5.1) and 3.6 (2.0-5.2), respectively). Surgery performed ‚â•¬†7¬†weeks after SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis was associated with a similar mortality risk to baseline (odds ratio (95%CI) 1.5 (0.9-2.1)). After a ‚â•¬†7¬†week delay in undertaking surgery following SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients with ongoing symptoms had a higher mortality than patients whose symptoms had resolved or who had been asymptomatic (6.0% (95%CI 3.2-8.7) vs. 2.4% (95%CI 1.4-3.4) vs. 1.3% (95%CI 0.6-2.0), respectively).

,"Both pathogenic bacteria and viruses are frequently detected in the nasopharynx (NP) of children in the absence of acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms. The aim of this study was to estimate the aetiological fractions for ARI hospitalisation in children for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus and to determine whether detection of specific respiratory pathogens on NP samples was associated with ARI hospitalisation.
349 children up to 5 years of age hospitalised for ARI (following a symptom-based case definition) and 306 hospital controls were prospectively enrolled in 16 centres across seven European Union countries between 2016 and 2019. Admission day NP swabs were analysed by multiplex PCR for 25 targets.
RSV was the leading single cause of ARI hospitalisations, with an overall population attributable fraction (PAF) of 33.4% and high seasonality as well as preponderance in younger children. Detection of RSV on NP swabs was strongly associated with ARI hospitalisation (OR adjusted for age and season: 20.6, 95%‚ÄâCI: 9.4 to 45.3). Detection of three other viral pathogens showed strong associations with ARI hospitalisation: influenza viruses had an adjusted OR of 6.1 (95%‚ÄâCI: 2.5 to 14.9), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) an adjusted OR of 4.6 (95%‚ÄâCI: 1.8 to 11.3) and metapneumoviruses an adjusted OR of 4.5 (95%‚ÄâCI: 1.3 to 16.1). Influenza viruses had a PAF of 7.9%, PIVs of 6.5% and metapneumoviruses of 3.0%. In contrast, most other pathogens were found in similar proportions in cases and controls, including

In the mouse, uterine glands are located in the lateral and antimesometrial regions of the uterine horn. Previous three-dimensional (3D)-imaging of the adult uterus, its glands, and implanting embryos has been performed by multiple groups, using fluorescent microscopy. Adenogenesis, the formation of uterine glands, initiates after birth. Recently, we created a 3D-staging system of mouse uterine gland development at postnatal time points, using light sheet fluorescent microscopy. Here, using a similar approach, we examine the morphological changes in the epithelium of the perinatal mouse uterus.

We also provided the implications of these interactions on the fisher's behaviors and how the acculturation process (e.g., introduction of new religions) can affect the fishers' worldview.
The selection of participants was done through intentional sampling. The content qualitative analysis was carried out to interpret the data from semi-structured interviews with 29 artisanal fishers.

,"Thirty years ago, the transgender child would have made no sense to the general public, nor to young people. Today, children and adolescents declare themselves transgender, the National Health Service diagnoses 'gender dysphoria', and laws and policy are developed which uphold young people's 'choice' to transition and to authorize stages at which medical intervention is permissible and desirable. The figure of the 'transgender child' presumed by medicine and law is not a naturally occurring category of person external to medical diagnosis and legal protection. Medicine and law construct the 'transgender child' rather than that the 'transgender child' exists independently of medico-legal discourse. The ethical issue of whether the child and young person can 'consent' to social and medical transition goes beyond legal assessment of whether a person under16 years has the mental capacity to consent, understand to what s/he is consenting, and can express independent wishes.

,"A considerable amount of research has been put into the explanation of the origin of the vampire myth by focussing on possible symptoms of the vampire; however, very little attention has been given to the victims.
To elucidate whether the myth of vampire victims follows the course of disease of acute leukaemia.
We studied three classical vampire novels published 1819-1897, focusing on 8 victims and their symptoms.

,"The activity patterns of children, especially after-school patterns, are receiving more professional attention. However, evidence regarding the value of various activities in children's lives is contradictory. The purpose of this study was to assess perceptions of discretionary activities, overscheduling, and levels of stress from adolescents' perspective.
A sample of 882 children, ages 9 to 13, recruited at 9 health education centers in the United States was selected for this study. Children answered questionnaires using remote, handheld devices. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression. The outcomes of interest were activity-based stress and desire for more free time.
The primary predictor for the desire for more free time was hours of screen time (television, computer, video games): those who reported 3 or more hours were nearly 3 times more likely to desire more free time. Further, children who chose their own activities experienced more activity-related stress than those who shared decisions with parents. The single greatest predictor of activity-related stress was the reported number of hours spent on homework. Students who averaged at least 2 hours on homework per night were nearly twice as likely to report frequent activity-related stress.
Parents of school-aged children should assess activity-related stress and the degree to which children perceive they are busy.

,"Performance is an essential part of music education; however, many music professionals and students suffer from music performance anxiety (MPA). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a 10-min expressive writing intervention (EWI) can effectively reduce performance anxiety and improve overall performance outcomes in college-level piano students. Two groups of music students (16 piano major students and 19 group/secondary piano students) participated in the study. Piano major students performed a solo work from memory, while group/secondary piano students took a sight-reading exam of an eight-measure piano musical selection. All students performed twice, at baseline and post-EWI, with 2 or 3 days between performances. During the EWI phase, students were randomly divided into two groups: an expressive writing group and a control group. Students in the expressive writing group wrote down feelings and thoughts about their upcoming performances, while students in the control group wrote about a topic unrelated to performing. Each student's pulse was recorded immediately before performing, and each performance was videotaped. Three independent judges evaluated the recordings using a modified version of the Observational Scale for Piano Practicing (OSPP) by Gruson (1988). The results revealed that, by simply writing out their thoughts and feelings right before performing, students who had high MPA improved their performance quality significantly and reduced their MPA significantly.

,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to investigate corticospinal output changes in 10 professional piano players during motor imagery of triad chords in C major to be ""mentally"" performed with three fingers of the right hand (thumb, index, and little finger). Five triads were employed in the task; each composed by a stable 3rd interval (C4-E4) and a varying third note that could generate a 5th (G4), a 6th (A4), a 7th (B4), a 9th (D5), or a 10th (E5) interval. The 10th interval chord was thought to be impossible in actual execution for biomechanical reasons, as long as the thumb and the index finger remained fixed on the 3rd interval. Chords could be listened from loudspeakers, read on a staff, or listened and read at the same time while performing the imagery task. The corticospinal output progressively increased along with task demands in terms of mental representation of hand extension. The effects of audio, visual, or audiovisual musical stimuli were generally similar, unless motor imagery of kinetically impossible triads was required. A specific three-effector motor synergy was detected, governing the representation of the progressive mental extension of the hand. Results demonstrate that corticospinal facilitation in professional piano players can be modulated according to the motor plan, even if simply ""dispatched"" without actual execution. Moreover, specific muscle synergies, usually encoded in the motor cortex, emerge along the cross-modal elaboration of musical stimuli and in motor imagery of musical performances.",['Simply Piano by JoyTunes'],"[{'lastname': 'Rossi', 'firstname': 'Simone', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Surgery and Neuroscience, Unit of Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology, Siena Brain Investigation and Neuromodulation Lab (Si-BIN Lab), University of Siena, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Spada', 'firstname': 'Danilo', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Brain and Behavioral Sciences, University of Pavia, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Emanuele', 'firstname': 'Marco', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Section of Human Physiology, University of Ferrara, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Ulivelli', 'firstname': 'Monica', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Surgery and Neuroscience, Unit of Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology, Siena Brain Investigation and Neuromodulation Lab (Si-BIN Lab), University of Siena, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Santarnecchi', 'firstname': 'Emiliano', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Surgery and Neuroscience, Unit of Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology, Siena Brain Investigation and Neuromodulation Lab (Si-BIN Lab), University of Siena, Italy.\nBerenson-Allen Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation, Department of Neurology, Division of Cognitive Neurology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Fadiga', 'firstname': 'Luciano', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Section of Human Physiology, University of Ferrara, Italy.\nCenter for Translational Neurophysiology, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Prattichizzo', 'firstname': 'Domenico', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Human Centered Robotics Group, SIRSLab, Department of Information Engineering and Mathematics, University of Siena, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Rossi', 'firstname': 'Alessandro', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Surgery and Neuroscience, Unit of Neurology and Clinical Neurophysiology, Siena Brain Investigation and Neuromodulation Lab (Si-BIN Lab), University of Siena, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Perani', 'firstname': 'Daniela', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Vita Salute San Raffaele University, Division of Neuroscience, Scientific Institute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.'}]",,,10.1155/2019/1328453,Neural plasticity,[],,2019-05-17,31093269,,Cross-Modal Audiovisual Modulation of Corticospinal Motor Synergies in Professional Piano Players: A TMS Study during Motor Imagery.,16

,"The purpose of the study was to evaluate implicit learning in children with developmental language disorder (DLD) by employing a visual artificial grammar learning task.
Thirteen children with DLD and 24 children with typical language development between the ages of 8 and 12 years completed a visual artificial grammar learning task. During the training phase of the task, participants were presented with strings of shapes that followed the underlying structure of a finite grammar. During the testing phase, participants were asked to judge whether new strings were grammatical or nongrammatical. Grammatical judgment of new strings served to measure generalization of the underlying grammatical structure. Endorsement based on chunk strength, or similarity to training exemplars, served to evaluate the extent to which children relied on surface features to guide their task performance.
As a group, children with typical development performed better on the artificial grammar learning task, compared with children with DLD, and accepted more grammatical strings regardless of their similarity to training exemplars. Task performance in both groups was not affected by surface features. Performance of children with DLD whose test accuracy exceeded the learning threshold of 0.5 was consistent with a generalization of the underlying grammatical structure that was unaffected by surface features.
The study found group differences in learning outcomes between children with and without DLD. Consistent with previous reports, children with typical development correctly endorsed more grammatical strings than children with DLD, suggesting a better acquisition of the grammatical structure. However, there was no evidence to suggest that children in the DLD group (learners and nonlearners) relied on surface features (i.e., familiarity to training exemplars) in their grammatical judgment.

Here, a neural network that creates molecules that meet some desired multiple target conditions based on a deep understanding of chemical language is proposed (generative chemical Transformer, GCT). The attention mechanism in GCT allows a deeper understanding of molecular structures beyond the limitations of chemical language itself which cause semantic discontinuity by paying attention to characters sparsely. The significance of language models for inverse molecular design problems is investigated by quantitatively evaluating the quality of the generated molecules. GCT generates highly realistic chemical strings that satisfy both chemical and linguistic grammar rules.

,"How children learn grammar is one of the most fundamental questions in cognitive science. Two theoretical accounts, namely, the Early Abstraction and Usage-Based accounts, propose competing answers to this question. To compare the predictions of these accounts, we tested the comprehension of 92 24-month old children of transitive sentences with novel verbs (e.g., ""The boy is gorping the girl!"") with the Intermodal Preferential Looking (IMPL) task. We found very little evidence that children looked to the target video at above-chance levels. Using mixed and mixture models, we tested the predictions the two accounts make about: (i) the structure of individual differences in the IMPL task and (ii) the relationship between vocabulary knowledge, lexical processing, and performance in the IMPL task. However, the results did not strongly support either of the two accounts.

,"Second-language learning (SLL) depends on distinct functional-neuroanatomical systems including procedural and declarative long-term memory. Characteristic features of rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep such as rapid eye movements and sleep spindles are electrophysiological markers of cognitively complex procedural and declarative memory consolidation, respectively. In adults, grammatical learning depends at first on declarative memory (""early SLL"") then shifts to procedural memory with experience (""late SLL""). However, it is unknown if the shift from declarative to procedural memory in early vs late SLL is supported by sleep. Here, we hypothesized that increases in sleep spindle characteristics would be associated with early SLL, whereas increases in REM activity (eg, density and EEG theta-band activity time-locked to rapid eye movements) would be associated with late SLL.
Eight Anglophone (English first language) participants completed four polysomnographic recordings throughout an intensive 6-week French immersion course. Sleep spindle data and electroencephalographic spectral power time-locked to rapid eye movements were extracted from parietal temporal electrodes.
As predicted, improvements in French proficiency were associated with changes in spindles during early SLL. Furthermore, we observed increased event-related theta power time-locked to rapid eye movements during late SLL compared with early SLL. The increases in theta power were significantly correlated with improvements in French proficiency.
This supports the notion that sleep spindles are involved in early SLL when grammar depends on declarative memory, whereas cortical theta activity time-locked to rapid eye movements is involved in late SLL when grammar depends on procedural memory.",['Learn English - Language & Grammar'],"[{'lastname': 'Thompson', 'firstname': 'Kristen', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Gibbings', 'firstname': 'Aaron', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.\nSleep Unit, University of Ottawa Institute of Mental Health at the Royal, Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Shaw', 'firstname': 'James', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Ray', 'firstname': 'Laura', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'H√©bert', 'firstname': 'Gilles', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'De Koninck', 'firstname': 'Joseph', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.\nUniversity of Ottawa Brain and Mind Research Institute, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Fogel', 'firstname': 'Stuart', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.\nSleep Unit, University of Ottawa Institute of Mental Health at the Royal, Ottawa, ON, Canada.\nUniversity of Ottawa Brain and Mind Research Institute, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada.'}]",,¬© 2021 Thompson et al.,10.2147/NSS.S326151,Nature and science of sleep,"['declarative memory', 'language', 'learning', 'memory consolidation', 'procedural memory', 'theta']",,2021-10-28,34703346,,Sleep and Second-Language Acquisition Revisited: The Role of Sleep Spindles and Rapid Eye Movements.,10

,"Temperature and oxygen limit the distribution of marine ectotherms. Haematological traits underlying blood-oxygen carrying capacity are thought to be correlated with thermal tolerance in certain fishes, and this relationship is hypothesised to be explained by oxygen supply capacity. We tested this hypothesis using reef shark neonates as experimental models because they live near their upper thermal limits and are physiologically sensitive to low oxygen conditions. We first described in situ associations between temperature and oxygen at the study site (Moorea, French Polynesia) and found that the habitats for reef shark neonates (Carcharhinus melanopterus and Negaprion acutidens) were hyperoxic at the maximum recorded temperatures. Next, we tested for in situ associations between thermal habitat characteristics and haematological traits of neonates.

,"Climate change is affecting thermal regimes globally, and organisms relying on their environment to regulate biological processes face unknown consequences. In ectotherms, temperature affects development rates, body condition, and performance. Embryonic stages may be the most vulnerable life history stages, especially for oviparous species already living at the warm edge of their distribution, as embryos cannot relocate during this developmental window. We reared 27 epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) embryos under average summer conditions (27¬†¬∞C) or temperatures predicted for the middle and end of the twenty-first century with climate change (i.e., 29 and 31¬†¬∞C) and tracked growth, development, and metabolic costs both in ovo and upon hatch. Rearing sharks at 31¬†¬∞C impacted embryonic growth, yolk consumption, and metabolic rates. Upon hatch, 31¬†¬∞C-reared sharks weighed significantly less than their 27¬†¬∞C-reared counterparts and exhibited reduced metabolic performance. Many important growth and development traits in this species may peak after 27¬†¬∞C and start to become negatively impacted nearing 31¬†¬∞C. We hypothesize that 31¬†¬∞C approximates the pejus temperature (i.e., temperatures at which performance of a trait begin to decline) for this species, which is alarming, given that this temperature range is well within ocean warming scenarios predicted for this species' distribution over the next century.",['Pinkfong Baby Shark'],"[{'lastname': 'Wheeler', 'firstname': 'Carolyn R', 'initials': 'CR', 'affiliation': 'Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life, New England Aquarium, Boston, MA, 02110, USA. carolyn.wheeler23@gmail.com.\nSchool for the Environment, The University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, MA, 02125, USA. carolyn.wheeler23@gmail.com.\nARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, James Cook University, 1 James Cook Drive, Douglas, Townsville, QLD, 4814, Australia. carolyn.wheeler23@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Rummer', 'firstname': 'Jodie L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies, James Cook University, 1 James Cook Drive, Douglas, Townsville, QLD, 4814, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Bailey', 'firstname': 'Barbara', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Animal Care Division, New England Aquarium, Boston, MA, 02110, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lockwood', 'firstname': 'Jamie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life, New England Aquarium, Boston, MA, 02110, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Vance', 'firstname': 'Shelby', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life, New England Aquarium, Boston, MA, 02110, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Mandelman', 'firstname': 'John W', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': 'Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life, New England Aquarium, Boston, MA, 02110, USA.\nSchool for the Environment, The University of Massachusetts Boston, Boston, MA, 02125, USA.'}]",,,10.1038/s41598-020-79953-0,Scientific reports,[],,2021-01-14,33436769,,Future thermal regimes for epaulette sharks (Hemiscyllium ocellatum): growth and metabolic performance cease to be optimal.,10

,"Severe early defoliation has become an important factor restricting the development of the pear industry in southern China. However, the assembly patterns of microbial communities and their functional activities in response to the application of bioorganic fertilizer (BIO) or humic acid (HA) in southern China's pear orchards remain poorly understood, particularly the impact on the early defoliation of the trees. We conducted a 3-year field experiment (2017-2019) in an 18-year-old 'Cuiguan' pear orchard. Four fertilization schemes were tested: local custom fertilization as control (CK), CK plus HA (CK-HA), BIO, and BIO plus HA (BIO-HA). Results showed that BIO and BIO-HA application decreased the early defoliation rate by 50-60%, and increased pear yield by 40% compared with the CK and CK-HA treatments. The BIO and BIO-HA application significantly improved soil pH, available nutrient content, total enzyme activity and ecosystem multifunctionality, and also changed the structure of soil bacterial and fungal communities. The genus Acidothermus was positively correlated with the early defoliation rate, while the genus Rhodanobacter was negatively correlated. Additionally, random forest models revealed that the early defoliation rate could be best explained by soil pH, ammonium content, available phosphorus, and total enzyme activity. In conclusion, application of BIO or BIO mixed with HA could have assembled distinct microbial communities and increased total enzyme activity, leading to significant improvement of soil physicochemical traits. The increased availability of soil nutrient thus changed leaf nutrient concentrations and alleviated the early defoliation rate of pear trees in acid red soil in southern China.",['Cars'],"[{'lastname': 'Kang', 'firstname': 'Yalong', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Jiangsu Provincial Key Lab for Organic Solid Waste Utilization, National Engineering Research Center for Organic-Based Fertilizers, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Solid Organic Waster Resource Utilization, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.'}, {'lastname': 'An', 'firstname': 'Xiangrui', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Jiangsu Provincial Key Lab for Organic Solid Waste Utilization, National Engineering Research Center for Organic-Based Fertilizers, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Solid Organic Waster Resource Utilization, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Ma', 'firstname': 'Yanwei', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Jiangsu Provincial Key Lab for Organic Solid Waste Utilization, National Engineering Research Center for Organic-Based Fertilizers, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Solid Organic Waster Resource Utilization, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zeng', 'firstname': 'Shaomin', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Fruit Research Institute, Research Centre for Engineering Technology of Fujian Deciduous Fruits, Fujian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Fuzhou, 350013, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Jiang', 'firstname': 'Shangtao', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Jiangsu Provincial Key Lab for Organic Solid Waste Utilization, National Engineering Research Center for Organic-Based Fertilizers, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Solid Organic Waster Resource Utilization, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Wenli', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Jiangsu Provincial Key Lab for Organic Solid Waste Utilization, National Engineering Research Center for Organic-Based Fertilizers, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Solid Organic Waster Resource Utilization, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xie', 'firstname': 'Changyan', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'The Research Center of Agricultural Resources Environment and Soil Fertilizer, Huaian Academy of Agricultural Sciencess, Huaian, 223001, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Zhonghua', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Pomology, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanjing, 210014, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Dong', 'firstname': 'Caixia', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Jiangsu Provincial Key Lab for Organic Solid Waste Utilization, National Engineering Research Center for Organic-Based Fertilizers, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Solid Organic Waster Resource Utilization, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China. cxdong@njau.edu.cn.'}, {'lastname': 'Xu', 'firstname': 'Yangchun', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Jiangsu Provincial Key Lab for Organic Solid Waste Utilization, National Engineering Research Center for Organic-Based Fertilizers, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Solid Organic Waster Resource Utilization, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Shen', 'firstname': 'Qirong', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Jiangsu Provincial Key Lab for Organic Solid Waste Utilization, National Engineering Research Center for Organic-Based Fertilizers, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center for Solid Organic Waster Resource Utilization, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China.'}]",,¬© 2021.

,"To examine the effect of the Virtual Sprouts intervention, an interactive multiplatform mobile gardening game, on dietary intake and psychosocial determinants of dietary behavior in minority youth.
In this quasi-experimental pilot intervention, 180 third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade students in Los Angeles Unified School District participated in a 3-week program that included three Virtual Sprouts gaming sessions, three in-school lessons, and three in-home activities, using a nutrition- and gardening-focused curriculum. Pre- and postintervention questionnaires were used to assess psychosocial determinants of dietary behavior, including knowledge about and self-efficacy to eat fruits and vegetables (FV). Data were collected on FV, whole grains, fiber, total sugar, added sugar, and energy from sugary beverages through the Block Kids Food Screener (""last week"" version) for Ages 2-17. Repeated measures analysis of covariance models was used for continuous outcomes, controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, school, and free school lunch.
After the intervention, the intervention group (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ116) compared with the control group (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ64) had a significantly improved self-efficacy to eat FV score (+1.6% vs. -10.3%, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.01), and an improved self-efficacy to cook FV score (+2.9% vs. -5.0%, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.05).

,"The COVID-19 outbreak necessitated a reorganization of the rehabilitation practices for Learning Disorders (LDs). During the lockdown phase, telerehabilitation offered the possibility to continue training interventions while enabling social distancing. Given such an advantage of telerehabilitation methods for LDs, clinical research is still needed to test the effectiveness of diverse teletraining approaches by comparing their outcomes with those of face-to-face interventions. To compare the effectiveness of telerehabilitation vs. in-presence rehabilitation of dyslexia, a rhythm-based intervention for reading, called Rhythmic Reading Training (RRT), was tested in a small-scale clinical trial during the lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thirty children aged 8-13 with a diagnosis of developmental dyslexia were assigned to either a telerehabilitation or an in-presence rehabilitation setting and received RRT for 10 biweekly sessions of 45 min, supervised by a trained practitioner. The results showed that both telerehabilitation and in-presence rehabilitation were effective in improving reading and rapid automatized naming in children with dyslexia and that the effects were comparable between settings. Therefore, RRT was found to be effective in spite of the administration method (remote or in-presence). These results confirm the potential of telemedicine for the rehabilitation of LDs.

,"Computer audition (i.e., intelligent audio) has made great strides in recent years; however, it is still far from achieving holistic hearing abilities, which more appropriately mimic human-like understanding. Within an audio scene, a human listener is quickly able to interpret layers of sound at a single time-point, with each layer varying in characteristics such as location, state, and trait. Currently, integrated machine listening approaches, on the other hand, will mainly recognise only single events. In this context, this contribution aims to provide key insights and approaches, which can be applied in computer audition to achieve the goal of a more holistic intelligent understanding system, as well as identifying challenges in reaching this goal. We firstly summarise the state-of-the-art in traditional signal-processing-based audio pre-processing and feature representation, as well as automated learning such as by deep neural networks. This concerns, in particular, audio interpretation, decomposition, understanding, as well as ontologisation. We then present an agent-based approach for integrating these concepts as a holistic audio understanding system.

,"A longstanding question in cognitive neuroscience and in the bilingualism literature is how early language experience influences brain development and cognitive outcomes, and whether these effects are global or specific to language-related processes. The current investigation examined the effect of the timing of language learning on the performance and neural correlates of phonological and non-verbal working memory, subcomponents of executive function. Three groups of bilinguals, who varied in terms of the timing of second language learning (i.e., simultaneous bilinguals learned their two languages from birth; early and late bilinguals who learned their second language before or after 5 years of age, respectively), performed phonological and non-verbal working memory tasks in the magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Results showed that there were no group differences in performance on either of the tasks, or in the neural correlates of performance of the non-verbal task. However, critically, we showed that despite similar behavioural performance, the groups differed in the patterns of neural recruitment during performance of the phonological working memory task. The pattern of group differences was non-linear, demonstrating similar neural recruitment for simultaneous and late bilinguals that differed from early bilinguals. Findings from the current study suggest a dynamic mapping between the brain and cognition, contributing to our current understanding of the effect of the timing of language learning on cognitive processes and demonstrating a specific effect on language-related executive function.",['Learn Languages with Music'],"[{'lastname': 'Kousaie', 'firstname': 'Shanna', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, K1N 6N5, Canada; Cognitive Neuroscience Unit, Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, QC, H3A 2B4, Canada; Centre for Research on Brain, Language and Music, McGill University, Montreal, QC, H3G 2A8, Canada.

,"The hypothesis that local conformational differences of snake venom cardiotoxins (cytotoxins, CTs) may play a significant role in their interaction with membrane was tested by molecular modeling of the behavior of the CT A5 from the venom of Naja atra in water and at the water-membrane interface. Two models of the CT A5 spatial structure are known: the first was obtained by X-ray analysis and the second, by NMR studies in solution. A molecular dynamics (MD) analysis demonstrated that loop II of the toxin has a fixed omega-like shape in water, which does not depend on its initial structure. Interaction of the experimentally derived (X-ray and NMR) conformations and MD-simulated conformations of CT A5 with the lipid bilayer was studied by the Monte Carlo method using the previously developed model of the implicit membrane. The following was found: (1) Unlike the previously studied CT2 from the venom of cobra Naja oxiana, CT A5 has only loops I and II bound to the membrane, with the involvement of a lesser number of hydrophobic residues. (2) A long hydrophobic area is formed on the surface of CT A5 due to the omega-like shape of loop II and the arrangement of loop I in proximity to loop II. This hydrophobic area favors the toxin embedding into the lipid bilayer. (3) The toxin retains its conformation upon interaction with the membrane. (4). The CT A5 molecule has close values of the potential energy in the membrane and in an aqueous environment, which suggests a dynamic character of the binding. The results of the molecular modeling indicate a definite configuration of loops I and II and, consequently, a specific character of distribution of polar and apolar properties on the toxin surface, which turns out to be the most energetically favorable.

,"Ending preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 will not be possible without evidence-based strategies addressing the health and care of low birthweight (LBW, <2.5‚Äâkg) infants. The majority of LBW infants are born in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and account for more than 60%-80% of newborn deaths. Feeding promotion tailored to meet the nutritional needs of LBW infants in LMICs may serve a crucial role in curbing newborn mortality rates and promoting growth. The Low Birthweight Infant Feeding Exploration (LIFE) study aims to establish foundational knowledge regarding optimal feeding options for LBW infants in low-resource settings throughout infancy.
LIFE is a formative, multisite, observational cohort study involving 12 study facilities in India, Malawi and Tanzania, and using a convergent parallel, mixed-methods design. We assess feeding patterns, growth indicators, morbidity, mortality, child development and health system inputs that facilitate or hinder care and survival of LBW infants.
This study was approved by 11 ethics committees in India, Malawi, Tanzania and the USA. The results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations targeting the global and local research, clinical, programme implementation and policy communities.

,"Respiratory Tract Infections (RTIs) and Gastro-Intestinal (GI) infections are the leading causes of child mortality and morbidity. This study investigates the associations between the individual, household and slum-level determinants of children's health and vulnerability to RTIs and GI infections in peri-urban slums in India; an area of research interest at the Childhood Infections and Pollution Consortium.
The 2015-16 Indian National Family Health Survey was used for data analysis on children aged 0-5 years. NFHS-4 includes data on slums in eight Indian cities, including Delhi, Meerut, Kolkata, Indore, Mumbai, Nagpur, Hyderabad, Chennai. The outcome variables, having fever and cough (FeCo) and diarrhoea in the last two weeks, were used to define the phenotype of infections; for this analysis fever and cough were measures of RTIs and diarrhoea was used to measure GI infections. Exposures considered in this study include variables at the individual, household and slum level and were all informed by existing literature. Multilevel models were used to estimate the association between exposures and outcomes variables; a prior of Cauchy distribution with a scale of 2.5 was selected when building the multilevel logistic models.
The total sample size of the number of children included in the analysis was n = 1,424. Data was imputed to account for missingness, and the original and imputed sample showing similar distributions. Results showed that diarrhoea and FeCo were both found to be more present in younger children than older children by a few months. In fixed effects, the odds of developing FeCo were higher if the mother perceives the child was born smaller than average (AOR 4.41, 1.13-17.17, P<0.05) at individual level. On the other hand, the odds of the diarrhoea outcome were lower if the child was older (AOR 0.97, 0.96-0.98, P<0.05) at individual level, and household's water source was public tap or standpipe (AOR 0.54, 0.31-0.96, P<0.05) at household level.
The determinants of health, both social and related to health care, at all levels demonstrated linkages to child morbidity in RTIs and GI infections.

,"The COVID-19 pandemic has affected maternal and infant health globally both directly from infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and indirectly from changes in health care resulting from social, economic, and health care policies unique to each country. The developing countries have to share the disproportionate burden on maternal and infant health. In this review, we discuss the uncertainties resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, vertical transmission of the virus, and its effects on breastfeeding of the newborn. The problems of families and communities caring for mothers with COVID-19 and its impact on breastfeeding in newborns are discussed. The challenges posed by the pandemic have forced us to think and devise innovative solutions, including telemedicine help for antenatal counseling, breastfeeding education, and lactation support. Optimal utilization of resources and technology to find creative solutions at the individual and the community level will help in facilitating maternal-infant bonding soon after birth.

,"Procedural sedation required to improve the quality of Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) in infants and children. The ideal drug and route for sedation in children should have a rapid and reliable onset, atraumatic, palatable with minimal side effects, and rapid recovery. So, the aim of our study to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of intranasal midazolam and intranasal dexmedetomidine in pediatric patients for sedation during TTE.
Hundred children under three year of age, belonging to the American Society of Anaesthesiologists class-I and II, scheduled for TTE were divided into two groups by standard randomization technique. Patients in group-M received intranasal midazolam 0.2 mg/kg, whereas patients in group-D received intranasal dexmedetomidine 2 Œºg/kg prior to TTE under an adequately monitored anesthesia care. Onset and duration of sedation, heart rate, oxygen saturation, sonographer's, and parent's satisfaction scores were recorded.
All patients were successfully sedated for TTE. The average onset time, sedation time, awakening time and total time for Group-M were 7.3, 18.8, 29.51, 51 min and group-D were 10.1, 14.2, 24.9, 46.3 min, respectively and all were statistically significant (P < 0.001). TTE scan time of Group-M is 8.84 min and Group-D is 9.18 min and was statistically significant. Sonographer's and Parent's average satisfaction score for Group-M was 9.88, 10 and for Group-D was 7.64, 8.76, respectively, which were statistically significant (P < 0.001).
Intranasal midazolam and dexmedetomidine are safe and effective for sedation in TTE. Intranasal midazolam was found to be comparatively more effective in view of onset of action, sonographers, and parental satisfaction score, while sedation time, awakening time and total duration was significantly higher as compared to intranasal dexmedetomidine.",['Baby Panda Care 2'],"[{'lastname': 'Panda', 'firstname': 'Suvendu', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiac Anesthesia, U.N.

,"The pitch of harmonic complex tones (HCT) common in speech, music and animal vocalizations plays a key role in the perceptual organization of sound. Unraveling the neural mechanisms of pitch perception requires animal models but little is known about complex pitch perception by animals, and some species appear to use different pitch mechanisms than humans. Here, we tested rabbits' ability to discriminate the fundamental frequency (F0) of HCTs with missing fundamentals using a behavioral paradigm inspired by foraging behavior in which rabbits learned to harness a spatial gradient in F0 to find the location of a virtual target within a room for a food reward. Rabbits were initially trained to discriminate HCTs with F0s in the range 400-800 Hz and with harmonics covering a wide frequency range (800-16,000 Hz), and then tested with stimuli differing either in spectral composition to test the role of harmonic resolvability (Experiment 1), or in F0 range (Experiment 2), or both F0 and spectral content (Experiment 3). Together, these experiments show that rabbits can discriminate HCTs over a wide F0 range (200-1600 Hz) encompassing the range of conspecific vocalizations, and can use either the spectral pattern of harmonics resolved by the cochlea for higher F0s or temporal envelope cues resulting from interaction between unresolved harmonics for lower F0s. The qualitative similarity of these results to human performance supports using rabbits as an animal model for studies of pitch mechanisms providing species differences in cochlear frequency selectivity and F0 range of vocalizations are taken into account.",['Animal Sounds'],"[{'lastname': 'Wagner', 'firstname': 'Joseph D', 'initials': 'JD', 'affiliation': 'Eaton-Peabody Laboratories, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Boston, MA, United States.\nDepartment of Biomedical Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Gelman', 'firstname': 'Alice', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Eaton-Peabody Laboratories, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Boston, MA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Hancock', 'firstname': 'Kenneth E', 'initials': 'KE', 'affiliation': 'Eaton-Peabody Laboratories, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Boston, MA, United States.\nDepartment of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Chung', 'firstname': 'Yoojin', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Eaton-Peabody Laboratories, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Boston, MA, United States.\nDepartment of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Delgutte', 'firstname': 'Bertrand', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Eaton-Peabody Laboratories, Massachusetts Eye and Ear, Boston, MA, United States.\nDepartment of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States.'}]",,,10.1152/jn.00366.2021,Journal of neurophysiology,"['auditory behavior', 'pitch', 'place coding', 'rabbit', 'temporal coding']",,2021-12-09,34879207,,Rabbits use both spectral and temporal cues to discriminate the fundamental frequency of harmonic complexes with missing fundamentals.,0

,"Childhood underweight is one of the major public health problems in Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, most of the available evidence is related to the general community children, which had different risk and severity levels than orphan children. Even though under-five orphan children have a higher risk of being underweight, they are the most neglected population.
The study aims to determine the prevalence and factors associated with childhood underweight among orphaned preschool children in Southern Ethiopia.
A community-based analytical cross-sectional study was conducted among 367 orphans. The burden of childhood underweight was assessed using World Health Organization standard cutoff points below -2 SD using z-scores. All variables with a p-value of < 0.25 during binary logistic regression analysis were entered into a multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify predictor variables independently associated with underweight at a p-value of 0.05 with 95% CI.
In this study, the prevalence of underweight among orphan children was 27.4%. The main factors associated with underweight were female child (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 5.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) (2.83-9.92)), adult food as type of first complementary food (aOR = 2.47; 95% CI (1.24-4.94)), food insecurity (aOR = 1.98; 95% CI (1.23-3.21)), and child age from 24-59 months (aOR = 7.19; 95% CI (3.81-13.60)).
Childhood underweight is a public health problem in the study area. The sex of a child, type of first complementary food, household food security status, and child age were the major predictors of underweight. Therefore, appropriate dietary interventions, nutrition education, and increased food security status of orphan children are highly recommended.",['Preschooler World'],"[{'lastname': 'Tesfaye', 'firstname': 'Adane', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Human Nutrition, School of Public Health, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dilla University, Dilla, Ethiopia.'}, {'lastname': 'Wete', 'firstname': 'Andnet Tadesse', 'initials': 'AT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, School of Public Health, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dilla University, Dilla, Ethiopia.'}, {'lastname': 'Negassa', 'firstname': 'Belay', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, School of Public Health, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Dilla University, Dilla, Ethiopia.'}, {'lastname': 'Chane', 'firstname': 'Yawkal', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nutrition, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Kotebe Metropolitan University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.'}, {'lastname': 'Ejajo', 'firstname': 'Tekle', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Health Service Management, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Wachemo University, Hossana, Ethiopia.'}, {'lastname': 'Molla', 'firstname': 'Abebaw', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, College of Health Science, Mizan Tepi University, Mizan Tepi, Ethiopia.'}, {'lastname': 'Mingude', 'firstname': 'Alemu Basazin', 'initials': 'AB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nursing, College of Health Science, Debre Berhan University, Debre Berhan, Ethiopia.'}, {'lastname': 'Mengie', 'firstname': 'Tesfa', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Amhara Regional Health Bureau, Dessie, Ethiopia.'}, {'lastname': 'Habtegiorgis', 'firstname': 'Samuel Derbie', 'initials': 'SD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, College of Health Science, Debre Markos University, Debre Markos, Ethiopia.'}, {'lastname': 'Getacher', 'firstname': 'Lemma', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, College of Health Science, Debre Berhan University, Debre Berhan, Ethiopia.'}]",,¬© The Author(s) 2021.,10.1177/20503121211059694,SAGE open medicine,"['Southern Ethiopia', 'Underweight', 'orphan children', 'preschool', 'prevalence', 'under-five children']",,2021-12-07,34868591,,Factors associated with childhood underweight among orphaned preschool children: A community-based analytical cross-sectional study in Southern Ethiopia.,16
,"Early childhood caries (ECC), despite being a preventable disease, remains prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa. This study compared the occurrence of Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus in dental plaque from caries free and caries active Nigerian preschool children.
Structured questionnaire were administered to eighty (80) mothers to inquire about the sociodemographic characteristics of their children. Diagnosis of dental caries was made according to the diagnostic criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO). Supragingival plaque sample collected from caries free children and children with dental caries (cavitated and non-cavitated lesions) using wooden toothpicks were cultured anaerobically. Samples were cultured in anaerobiosis and isolates obtained were identified based on molecular characterization performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS 25.0) was used for analysis.
Streptococcus mutans was detected in 26(65.0%) children with early childhood caries, and S. sobrinus in 10(25.0%) children with early childhood caries. The presence of S. mutans and S. sobrinus occurring together was associated with a higher deft score. Occurrence of S. mutans did not show significant difference between children with ECC and caries free children (p=0.099), however, the proportion of children with ECC positive for S. sobrinus was significantly higher than that of caries free children (p= 0.003).
S. mutans and S. sobrinus had a similar frequency of occurrence in children with ECC and caries free children. The occurrence of S. mutans alongside S. sobrinus in ECC is related to its severity.

Trials of low-dose calcium supplementation (<‚Äâ1000‚Äâmg elemental calcium/day) during pregnancy have also shown similar reductions in the risk of preeclampsia; however, no trials to date have directly compared low-dose to the standard high-dose calcium supplementation. Our objective is to assess the non-inferiority of low-dose as compared to standard high-dose calcium supplementation in pregnancy.
We will conduct two independent trials in Bangalore, India (n = 11,000 pregnancies), and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (n = 11,000 pregnancies). The trial designs are individually randomized, parallel group, quadruple-blind, non-inferiority trials of low-dose calcium supplementation (500‚Äâmg elemental calcium/day) as compared to standard high-dose calcium supplementation (1500‚Äâmg elemental calcium/day) among nulliparous pregnant women. Pregnant women will be enrolled in the trial before 20‚Äâweeks of gestation and will receive the randomized calcium regimen from randomization until the time of delivery. The co-primary outcomes are (i) preeclampsia and (ii) preterm birth; we will test non-inferiority of the primary outcomes for low-dose as compared to the standard high-dose supplementation regimen in each trial. The trials' secondary outcomes include gestational hypertension, severe features of preeclampsia, pregnancy-related death, third trimester severe anemia, fetal death, stillbirth, low birthweight, small-for-gestational age birth, and infant death.
The trials will provide causal evidence on the non-inferiority of low-dose as compared to the standard high-dose supplementation in India and Tanzania. A single tablet, low-dose calcium supplementation regimen may improve individual-level adherence, reduce programmatic costs, and ultimately expand implementation of routine calcium supplementation in pregnancy in populations with low dietary calcium intake.

,"Influenza is a respiratory infectious disease that can seriously affect human health. Influenza virus has frequent antigenic drifts that can facilitate escape from pre-existing population immunity and lead to rapid and widespread transmission. Seasonal influenza is characterized by annual epidemics and outbreaks in places of public gathering such as schools, kindergartens, and nursing homes. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), seasonal influenza causes 3 to 5 million severe cases and 290 000 to 650 000 deaths globally each year. Pregnant women, young children, the elderly, and persons with chronic medical conditions are at highest risk for severe illness and death from influenza virus infection. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 may co-circulate with influenza and other respiratory viruses in the upcoming winter-spring influenza season. Seasonal influenza vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza virus infection and complications from influenza. China has several licensed influenza vaccines - trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV3), which include split-virus influenza vaccine and subunit vaccine; quadrivalent split-virus inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4); and trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV3). With the exception of a few major cities, influenza vaccine is a non-program vaccine, which means that influenza vaccination is not included in China's Expanded Program on Immunization, and recipients must pay for influenza vaccine and its administration. China CDC has issued ""Technical Guidelines for Seasonal Influenza Vaccination in China"" every year from 2018 to 2020. This past year, there have been scientific and programmatic advances in prevention and control of seasonal influenza. To strengthen technical guidance for prevention and control of influenza and facilitate operational research on influenza vaccination, the National Immunization Advisory Committee (NIAC) Influenza Vaccination Technical Working Group (TWG) updated the 2020-2021 technical guidelines into the ""Technical Guidelines for Seasonal Influenza Vaccination in China (2021-2022)."" The new version has updates in five key areas: (1) new research evidence, especially from studies in China, on disease burden, vaccine effectiveness, vaccine-avoidable disease burden, vaccine safety monitoring, and cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses, (2) policies and measures for influenza prevention and control that were issued by National Health Commission (NHC) in the past year, (3) licensure of a new seasonal influenza vaccine in time for the 2021-2022 season, (4) composition of the northern hemisphere trivalent and quadrivalent influenza vaccines for the 2021-2022 season, and (5) recommendations for influenza vaccination during the 2021-2022 influenza season. The recommendations specify that immunization clinics should provide influenza vaccine to all persons aged 6 months and above who are willing to be vaccinated and do not have contraindications; the interval between receipt of influenza vaccine and COVID-19 vaccine should at least 14 days; and there is no preference for one influenza vaccine over another for persons for whom more than one licensed, recommended, and appropriate vaccine is available. Considering the global COVID-19 pandemic and the need to decrease risk of influenza virus infection and minimize potential impact on COVID-19 prevention and control, we recommend the following target population priorities in preparation for the 2021-2022 influenza season: (1) healthcare workers, including clinical doctors and nurses, public health professionals, and quarantine professionals, (2) volunteers and staff who provide service and support for large events, (3) people living in nursing homes or welfare homes and staff who take care of vulnerable, at-risk individuals, (4) people who work in high population density settings, including teachers and students in kindergartens, primary, and secondary schools and prisoners and prison staff, and (5) people with high risk of complications from influenza, including adults ‚â•60 years of age, children 6-59 months of age, persons with certain chronic conditions, family members and caregivers of infants <6 months of age, and pregnant women and women who plan to become pregnant during the influenza season. Children 6 months through 8 years of age who have never received influenza vaccine or who have received only one lifetime dose require 2 doses of influenza vaccine that are administered at least 4 weeks apart. This recommendation applies to both IIV and LAIV. If children received 2 doses of influenza vaccine in the 2020-2021 influenza season or received more than 2 doses of influenza vaccine in prior influenza seasons, 1 dose of influenza vaccine is recommended. People more than 9 years old require only 1 dose of influenza vaccine. People should receive influenza vaccination by the end of October, and influenza vaccine should be offered as soon as it is available. For people unable to be vaccinated before the end of October, influenza vaccine will continue to be offered throughout the season. Influenza vaccine is recommended for pregnant women during any trimester of pregnancy. These guidelines are intended for use by staff of CDCs at all levels who work on influenza control and prevention; immunization clinic staff members; healthcare workers from departments of pediatrics, internal medicine, and infectious diseases; and staff of maternity and child care institutions at all levels. The guidelines will be periodically updated as new evidence becomes available.

,"The clinical presentation and severity of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children associated with COVID-19 (MIS-C) is widespread and presents a very low mortality rate in high-income countries. This research describes the clinical characteristics of MIS-C in critically ill children in middle-income countries and the factors associated with the rate of mortality and patients with critical outcomes.
An observational cohort study was conducted in 14 pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in Colombia between April 01, 2020, and January 31, 2021. Patient age ranged between one month and 18 years, and each patient met the requirements set forth by the World Health Organization (WHO) for MIS-C.
There were seventy-eight children in this study. The median age was seven years (IQR 1-11), 18‚Äâ% (14/78) were under one year old, and 56‚Äâ% were male. 35‚Äâ% of patients (29/78) were obese or overweight. The PICU stay per individual was six days (IQR 4-7), and 100‚Äâ% had a fever upon arrival to the clinic lasting at least five days (IQR 3.7-6). 70‚Äâ% (55/78) of patients had diarrhea, and 87‚Äâ% (68/78) had shock or systolic myocardial dysfunction (78‚Äâ%). Coronary aneurysms were found in 35‚Äâ% (27/78) of cases, and pericardial effusion was found in 36‚Äâ%. When compared to existing data in high-income countries, there was a higher mortality rate observed (9‚Äâ% vs. 1.8‚Äâ%; p=0.001). When assessing the group of patients that did not survive, a higher frequency of ferritin levels was found, above 500 ngr/mL (100‚Äâ% vs. 45‚Äâ%; p=0.012), as well as more cardiovascular complications (100‚Äâ% vs. 54‚Äâ%; p = 0.019) when compared to the group that survived. The main treatments received were immunoglobulin (91‚Äâ%), vasoactive support (76‚Äâ%), steroids (70.5‚Äâ%) and antiplatelets (44‚Äâ%).
Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children due to SARS-CoV-2 in critically ill children living in a middle-income country has some clinical, laboratory, and echocardiographic characteristics similar to those described in high-income countries. The observed inflammatory response and cardiovascular involvement were conditions that, added to the later presentation, may explain the higher mortality seen in these children.",['Preschooler World'],"[{'lastname': 'Acevedo', 'firstname': 'Lorena', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pediatrics and Intensive Care.

,"Many mental health problems emerge in late childhood and contribute significantly to the global burden of disease. Adverse outcomes can extend into adulthood if left untreated. This impact is exacerbated in low- and middle-income countries where significant treatment gaps persist. Improving mental health literacy may offer an effective strategy for early intervention but remains underexplored in these contexts.
An intervention was co-developed with children and young people (CYP) by undertaking a needs analysis combined with stakeholder consensus activities. A systematic review of mental health literacy interventions in South-East Asia was undertaken in addition to semi-structured interviews with 43 children and young people (19 with and 24 without experience of anxiety and depression), 19 parents of children with experience of mental health problems and 25 education and health professionals. A focus group was also held with 8 key stakeholders immersed¬†nationally in policy and practice. Interview schedules explored participants' experiences of mental health, unmet needs and priorities for intervention. Data were synthesised and presented at a 3-day co-production workshop. Attendees included 13 CYP, 6 parents/guardians, 2 teachers, 8 health professionals, 2 academics and 3 game designers. Consensus exercises were utilised to identify the preferred format, content and delivery of the¬†intervention. A smaller group of patient and public involvement contributors worked with designers to further iterate the intervention.
An immersive storyline digital application was co-developed for young people aged 11-15 with the primary aim of improving mental health literacy and self-management. The intervention comprises two chapters; one depression focussed, and the other anxiety focussed. The storyline format is interspersed with interactive games and exercises to promote engagement and encourage self-management. CYP also take part in group sessions delivered by trained facilitators before and after intervention use to discuss outcomes of and issues raised during the game.
The IMPeTUs intervention has been co-designed for CYP aged 11-15 to improve mental health literacy and enhance self-management abilities.

,"Handheld devices can automatically give an estimate of refraction. The established method for refraction comparison using spherical equivalent (M) and J0, J45 vector transformations by Bland-Altman analysis is too complex for non-eye doctors involved with vision screening and remote vision clinics. Therefore, a simpler comparison technique was developed.
Based on the spectacle limit to resolve grade A 1 logMAR, B 3 logMAR and C 6 logMAR blur, J0, J45, and M are combined into the Alaska Blind Child Discovery (ABCD) composite ellipsoid GRADE system. Pediatric eye patients had confirmatory examination after dry refraction with three portable autorefractors: Plusoptix, 2WIN and Retinomax. The refractions were then compared using both Bland-Altman and ABCD composite. Performance to detect AAPOS amblyopia risk factors was also assessed.
A total of 202 children, mean age seven years, 28% high spectacle need and 43% AAPOS 2013 amblyopia risk factors showed high correlation with cycloplegic refraction (intraclass correlation 0.49 to 0.90) for sphere, J0 and J45 spectacle components. Plusoptix had more (10%) inconclusives due to patients out-of-range. The Retinomax was unable to screen some younger children and was less reliable for sphere but gave more precise astigmatism estimates. The proportion of autorefractions expected to give GRADE A/B high-need patients acuity improvement to 20/40 would be 41% for Plusoptix, 39% for 2WIN and 65% for Retinomax. Sensitivity/specificity for amblyopia risk factor detection was 80%/83% for Plusoptix, 72%/88% for 2WIN and 84%/73% for Retinomax.

,"Procedural pain and anxiety in children can be poorly controlled, leading to significant short- and long-term sequelae, such as longer procedure times or future healthcare avoidance. Caregiver anxiety can exacerbate these effects. We aimed to evaluate the effect of interactive video game interventions on children's procedural pain and anxiety, including the effect of different types of video games on those outcomes.
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of interactive video games compared with standard care in children (0-18 yr) undergoing painful procedures. We searched the databases MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis using 'R' of children's procedural pain and anxiety and caregivers' anxiety.
Of 2185 studies screened, 36 were eligible (n=3406 patients). Studies commonly involved venous access (33%) or day surgery (31%). Thirty-four studies were eligible for meta-analyses. Interactive video games appear to reduce children's procedural pain (standardised mean difference [SMD]=-0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.67 to -0.20), anxiety (SMD=0.61; 95% CI: -0.88 to -0.34), and caregivers' procedural anxiety (SMD=-0.31; 95% CI: -0.58 to -0.04). We observed no difference between preparatory and distracting games, or between virtual reality and non-virtual reality games. We also observed no difference between interactive video games compared with standard care for most medical outcomes (e.g. procedure length), except a reduced need for restraint. Studies reported minimal adverse effects and typically had high intervention acceptability and satisfaction.

,"Developing self-determination skills is an important component of youth's maturation. However, many youths with disabilities lack opportunities to engage in activities that can promote these skills. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of self-determination interventions for children and youth with disabilities.
A systematic review was performed on seven international databases that identified 28 studies meeting our inclusion criteria.
Among the 28 studies, 5184 youth with disabilities (aged 9-29, mean age 16.8 years) were represented across three countries. The interventions varied in duration, length, number of sessions, and delivery format, which included curriculum-based, workshops, experiential or residential learning, peer coaching and mentoring, self-directed individual learning, computer games, and multi-component designs. 19/28 studies reported a significant improvement in self-determination. Of these 13/18 studies showed improvements as measured by Arc's self-determination scale, while 8/13 studies reported a significant improvement as measured by AIR self-determination scale. Other significant differences were reported in vocational skills self-efficacy and self-determination inventory.
Our findings highlight that there are several types of interventions that have the potential to improve self-determination for youth with disabilities. Further research is needed to understand what program components could help youth to obtain optimal outcomes.Implications for RehabilitationSeveral types of interventions (school-based, community, online) have potential to influence self-determination for youth with disabilities.Clinicians and educators should consider having multiple components including workshops, one-to-one and group-based learning, mentoring and coaching for optimal program outcomes.Interventions that are targeted to enhance self-determination for youth with disabilities should be theoretically informed and use a validated measure to assess their effectiveness.",['Kids School - Games for Kids'],"[{'lastname': 'Lindsay', 'firstname': 'Sally', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Bloorview Research Institute, Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital, Toronto, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Varahra', 'firstname': 'Azar', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Bloorview Research Institute, Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital, Toronto, Canada.'}]",,,10.1080/09638288.2021.1928776,Disability and rehabilitation,"[' self-determination', 'Independence', 'review', 'self-efficacy', 'youth']",,2021-06-01,34056997,"Among the 28 studies, 5184 youth with disabilities (aged 9-29, mean age 16.8 years) were represented across three countries.

,"Health games provide opportunities for the treatment and prevention of childhood obesity. We developed a motion-controlled serious game for children that addresses 3 core topics of nutrition, physical activity, and stress coping. It is the first serious game that extensively targets the dietary energy density principle (DED-P) in relation to nutrition. The game is intended to provide an additional educational component for the prevention and treatment of obesity in children.
The Kids Obesity Prevention study aimed to evaluate the newly developed game and to evaluate how well children are able to understand and apply the DED-P.
This cluster randomized controlled trial collected data from 82 primary school children aged 9 to 12 years and their parents at baseline (T0), at 2 weeks after study commencement (T1), and at the 4-week follow-up (T2). The dropout rate was 3.6%. The intervention group (IG) played the game within 2 weeks (2 sessions with different game modules). One part of the game involves selection of food with the lower energy density when presented with a pair of foods. This allows assessment of whether the children have understood the DED-P and whether they can apply it to unknown foods under time pressure. The control group (CG) received a brochure about the food pyramid concept and physical activity. The primary outcome was the gain in knowledge (nutrition and stress coping) and measured with a pretested questionnaire. The secondary outcomes were the maintenance of knowledge, application of the DED-P, feelings during game play, game acceptance, and behavioral measures (physical activity, media consumption, and dietary intake).
The knowledge score ranging from 0 to 100 increased from T0 (IG: 53 [SD 10], CG: 50 [SD 11]) to T1 (IG: 69 [SD 11], CG: 52 [SD 12]) in IG versus CG (P<.001). At T2, the knowledge score of IG remained at the same level as that of T1. Game data showed that after DED-P education, the classification under time pressure of unknown versus known food pairs according to their DED category was similar (hit rate around 70%). Overall, 95% of the children liked the game very much or much. No group changes were observed at the behavioral level.
The Kids Obesity Prevention program sustainably increased knowledge in the areas of nutrition and stress coping, and children were able to apply the DED-P.

Pre- and postintervention questionnaires were used to assess psychosocial determinants of dietary behavior, including knowledge about and self-efficacy to eat fruits and vegetables (FV). Data were collected on FV, whole grains, fiber, total sugar, added sugar, and energy from sugary beverages through the Block Kids Food Screener (""last week"" version) for Ages 2-17. Repeated measures analysis of covariance models was used for continuous outcomes, controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, school, and free school lunch.
After the intervention, the intervention group (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ116) compared with the control group (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ64) had a significantly improved self-efficacy to eat FV score (+1.6% vs. -10.3%, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.01), and an improved self-efficacy to cook FV score (+2.9% vs. -5.0%, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.05). There were no significant differences in dietary intake or self-efficacy to garden scores between intervention and control groups.

,"The prevention of obesity and improvement of academic achievement in children are concerns of industrialized societies. Obesity has been associated with psychological disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, whose prevalence has been estimated at 6.8 % in Spanish children and adolescents. It is known that physical activity is positively related to academic achievement and negatively related to the risk of obesity in children. However, studies to test the effectiveness of physical activity interventions in improving academic achievement in preschool children are scarce and have some weaknesses that threaten their validity. Moreover, very few studies have examined their effectiveness in improving symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. This paper outlines a two-year multidimensional preschool intervention (Movi-Kids) aimed at preventing obesity and improving academic achievement in children with or without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
Twenty-one schools from Ciudad Real and Cuenca, Spain, were randomized to intervention and control groups. In the first academic year, children in the third grade of preschool and the first grade of primary school in the intervention group received the Movi-Kids intervention. In the second academic year, schools were crossed over to the other group. The intervention included children, parents and teachers, and the school environment, and consisted of: (i) three hour-long sessions of recreational non-competitive physical activity after school, weekly, (ii) educational materials for parents and teachers addressing sedentary lifestyle risks and (iii) playground modifications to promote physical activity during breaks. Primary outcome measures of this study were academic achievement (intelligence, cognition, memory, attention and perception), assessed by the Battery of General and Differential Aptitudes, and adiposity measures (body mass index, waist circumference, triceps skinfold thickness and body fat percentage). Secondary outcome measures were: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder risk, motor skills, health-related quality of life and sleep quality. These variables will all be measured in both groups at baseline and at the end of the first and second academic years.
It seems reasonable that an intervention to promote physical activity based on playground games will be useful for simultaneously improving academic achievement and controlling obesity.

,"Children in households of lower socioeconomic status (SES) are more likely to be overweight/obese. We aimed to determine if home physical activity (PA) environments differed by SES and to explore home environment mediators of the relation of family SES to children's PA and sedentary behavior.
Participants were 715 children aged 6 to 11 from the Neighborhood Impact on Kids (NIK) Study. Household SES was examined using highest educational attainment and income. Home environment was measured by parent report on a survey. Outcomes were child's accelerometer-measured PA and parent-reported screen time. Mediation analyses were conducted for home environment factors that varied by SES.
Children from lower income households had greater media access in their bedrooms (TV 52% vs. 14%, DVD player 39% vs. 14%, video games 21% vs. 9%) but lower access to portable play equipment (bikes 85% vs. 98%, jump ropes 69% vs. 83%) compared to higher income children. Lower SES families had more restrictive rules about PA (2.5 vs. 2.0). Across SES, children watched TV/DVDs with parents/siblings more often than they engaged in PA with them. Parents of lower SES watched TV/DVDs with their children more often (3.1 vs. 2.5‚Äâdays/week). Neither total daily and home-based MVPA nor sedentary time differed by SES. Children's daily screen time varied from 1.7 hours/day in high SES to 2.4 in low SES families. Media in the bedroom was related to screen time, and screen time with parents was a mediator of the SES--screen time relationship.

,"Cartoonization as a special type of artistic style transfer is a difficult image processing task. The current existing artistic style transfer methods cannot generate satisfactory cartoon-style images due to that artistic style images often have delicate strokes and rich hierarchical color changes while cartoon-style images have smooth surfaces without obvious color changes, and sharp edges. To this end, we propose a cartoon loss based generative adversarial network (CartoonLossGAN) for cartoonization. Particularly, we first reuse the encoder part of the discriminator to build a compact generative adversarial network (GAN) based cartoonization architecture. Then we propose a novel cartoon loss function for the architecture. It can imitate the process of sketching to learn the smooth surface of the cartoon image, and imitate the coloring process to learn the coloring of the cartoon image. Furthermore, we also propose an initialization strategy, which is used in the scenario of reusing the discriminator to make our model training easier and more stable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed CartoonLossGAN can generate fantastic cartoon-style images, and outperforms four representative methods.",['Coloring & Learn'],"[{'lastname': 'Dong', 'firstname': 'Yongsheng', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tan', 'firstname': 'Wei', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Tao', 'firstname': 'Dacheng', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Zheng', 'firstname': 'Lintao', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Xuelong', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1109/TIP.2021.3130539,IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society,[],,2021-12-03,34855596,,CartoonLossGAN: Learning Surface and Coloring of Images for Cartoonization.,10
,"Predicates like ""coloring-the-star"" denote events that have a temporal duration and a culmination point (telos). When combined with perfective aspect (e.g., ""Valeria has colored the star""), a culmination inference arises implying that the action has stopped, and the star is fully colored. While the perfective aspect is known to constrain the conceptualization of the event as telic, many reading studies have demonstrated that readers do not make early commitments as to whether the event is bounded or unbounded. A few visual-world studies tested the processing of telic predicates during online sentence processing, demonstrating an early integration of aspectual and temporal cues. By employing the visual-world paradigm, we tested the incremental processing of the perfective aspect in Italian in two eye-tracking studies in which listeners heard durative predicates in the perfective form in a scenario showing a completed and a non-completed event. Differently from previous studies, we compared telic durative predicates such as ""coloring-the-star"" to punctual predicates such as ""lighting-the-candle."" While for punctual predicates, the inferences of telicity (the event has a telos) and of culmination (the telos is reached) are lexically encoded in the perfective verb, for durative predicates, the degree of event completion (visually encoded) needs to be integrated with perfective aspect (linguistically encoded) for the culmination inference derivation. By modulating the interaction of visual and linguistic stimuli across the two experiments, we show that the verb's perfective aspect triggers the culmination inference incrementally during sentence processing, offering novel evidence for the continuous integration of linguistic processing with real-world visual information.",['Coloring & Learn'],"[{'lastname': 'Foppolo', 'firstname': 'Francesca', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Milan-Bicocca.'}, {'lastname': 'Bosch', 'firstname': 'Jasmijn E', 'initials': 'JE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Milan-Bicocca.'}, {'lastname': 'Greco', 'firstname': 'Ciro', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Coveo AI Labs, Coveo.'}, {'lastname': 'Carminati', 'firstname': 'Maria N', 'initials': 'MN', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Panzeri', 'firstname': 'Francesca', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Milan-Bicocca.'}]",,¬© 2021 Cognitive Science Society LLC.,10.1111/cogs.13052,Cognitive science,"['Aspect', 'Incremental processing', 'Telicity', 'Visual world paradigm']",,2021-10-07,34614240,,Draw a Star and Make it Perfect: Incremental Processing of Telicity.,10

,"Both histologic subtypes and tumor mutation burden (TMB) represent important biomarkers in lung cancer, with implications for patient prognosis and treatment decisions. Typically, TMB is evaluated by comprehensive genomic profiling but this requires use of finite tissue specimens and costly, time-consuming laboratory processes. Histologic subtype classification represents an established component of lung adenocarcinoma histopathology, but can be challenging and is associated with substantial inter-pathologist variability. Here we developed a deep learning system to both classify histologic patterns in lung adenocarcinoma and predict TMB status using de-identified Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained whole slide images. We first trained a convolutional neural network to map histologic features across whole slide images of lung cancer resection specimens. On evaluation using an external data source, this model achieved patch-level area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.78-0.98 across nine histologic features. We then integrated the output of this model with clinico-demographic data to develop an interpretable model for TMB classification. The resulting end-to-end system was evaluated on 172 held out cases from TCGA, achieving an AUC of 0.71 (95% CI 0.63-0.80). The benefit of using histologic features in predicting TMB is highlighted by the significant improvement this approach offers over using the clinical features alone (AUC of 0.63 [95% CI 0.53-0.72], p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.002). Furthermore, we found that our histologic subtype-based approach achieved performance similar to that of a weakly supervised approach (AUC of 0.72 [95% CI 0.64-0.80]). Together these results underscore that incorporating histologic patterns in biomarker prediction for lung cancer provides informative signals, and that interpretable approaches utilizing these patterns perform comparably with less interpretable, weakly supervised approaches.",['Coloring & Learn'],"[{'lastname': 'Sadhwani', 'firstname': 'Apaar', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Google Health, Palo Alto, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Huang-Wei', 'initials': 'HW', 'affiliation': 'Verily Life Sciences, South San Francisco, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Behrooz', 'firstname': 'Ali', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Verily Life Sciences, South San Francisco, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Brown', 'firstname': 'Trissia', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Google Health via Vituity, Emeryville, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Auvigne-Flament', 'firstname': 'Isabelle', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Google Health via Vituity, Emeryville, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Patel', 'firstname': 'Hardik', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Verily Life Sciences, South San Francisco, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Findlater', 'firstname': 'Robert', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Verily Life Sciences, South San Francisco, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Velez', 'firstname': 'Vanessa', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Verily Life Sciences, South San Francisco, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Tan', 'firstname': 'Fraser', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Google Health, Palo Alto, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Tekiela', 'firstname': 'Kamilla', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Verily Life Sciences, South San Francisco, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Wulczyn', 'firstname': 'Ellery', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Google Health, Palo Alto, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Yi', 'firstname': 'Eunhee S', 'initials': 'ES', 'affiliation': 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Mermel', 'firstname': 'Craig H', 'initials': 'CH', 'affiliation': 'Google Health, Palo Alto, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hanks', 'firstname': 'Debra', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Verily Life Sciences, South San Francisco, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Po-Hsuan Cameron', 'initials': 'PC', 'affiliation': 'Google Health, Palo Alto, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kulig', 'firstname': 'Kimary', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Verily Life Sciences, South San Francisco, CA, USA.\nPathPresenter Corp., New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Batenchuk', 'firstname': 'Cory', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Verily Life Sciences, South San Francisco, CA, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Steiner', 'firstname': 'David F', 'initials': 'DF', 'affiliation': 'Google Health, Palo Alto, CA, USA. davesteiner@google.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Cimermancic', 'firstname': 'Peter', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Verily Life Sciences, South San Francisco, CA, USA.'}]",,¬© 2021.

,"Assessing the quality of food and spices is particularly important in ensuring proper human nutrition. The use of computer vision method as a non-destructive technique in measuring the quality of food and spices has always been taken into consideration by researchers. Due to the high nutritional value of turmeric among the spices as well as the fraudulent motives to gain economic profit from the selling of this product, its quality assessment is very important. The lack of marketability of grade 3 chickpeas (small and broken chickpeas) and their very low price have made them a good choice to be mixed with turmeric in powder form and sold in the market. In this study, an improved convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to classify turmeric powder images to detect fraud. CNN was improved through the use of gated pooling functions. We also show with a combined approach based on the integration of average pooling and max pooling that the accuracy and performance of the proposed CNN has increased. In this study, 6240 image samples were prepared in 13 categories (pure turmeric powder, chickpea powder, chickpea powder mixed with food coloring, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50% fraud in turmeric). In the preprocessing step, unwanted parts of the image were removed. The data augmentation (DA) was used to reduce the overfitting problem on CNN. Also in this research, MLP, Fuzzy, SVM, GBT and EDT algorithms were used to compare the proposed CNN results with other classifiers. The results showed that prevention of the overfitting problem using gated pooling, the proposed CNN was able to grade the images of turmeric powder with 99.36% accuracy compared to other classifiers.

Analysis of participant accounts confirmed the crucial importance of non-medicalised care in CYP diabetes care. A life plan was considered as important to participants as a health plan. Participants valued the holistic support provided by friends, family members and school teachers. However, they found structural barriers in their health and educational pathways as well as disparities in the quality of support at critical moments along the life course. They actively tried to maximise their well-being by balancing life priorities against diabetes priorities. Combined, these features could undermine participants engagement with health services where personal strategies were often held back or edited out of clinical appointments in fear of condemnation.
We demonstrate why diabetes health teams need to appreciate the conflicting pressures experienced by CYP and to coproduce more nuanced health plans for addressing their concerns regarding identity and risk taking behaviours in the context of their life-worlds. Exploring these issues and identifying ways to better support CYP to address them more proactively should reduce disengagement and set realistic health outcomes that make best use of medical resources.",['Farm Friends'],"[{'lastname': 'Sharpe', 'firstname': 'Darren', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Institute for Connected Communities (ICC), University of East London, London, UK d.sharpe@uel.ac.uk.'}, {'lastname': 'Rajabi', 'firstname': 'Mohsen', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.'}, {'lastname': 'Harden', 'firstname': 'Angela', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Maternal and Child Health Research, School of Health Sciences, City University of London, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Moodambail', 'firstname': 'Abdul Rehman', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Paediatrics, Newham University Hospital, Barts Health NHS Trust, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Hakeem', 'firstname': 'Vaseem', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust, Barnet and Chase Farm Hospitals NHS Trust, London, UK.'}]",We demonstrate why diabetes health teams need to appreciate the conflicting pressures experienced by CYP and to coproduce more nuanced health plans for addressing their concerns regarding identity and risk taking behaviours in the context of their life-worlds.

,"This paper aims to investigate the association between perceived production risk of horticultural farms and access to finance from different finance providers. The collection of data was conducted among 434 farmers in Indonesia particularly farmers produced mango, mangosteen, chili and red onion. Production risk was measured by the coefficient of variation, skewness, kurtosis and the 25th percentile. Depending on the risk measure, a lower production risk was found for commercial credit from banks and flexible payments of inputs to kiosks. Conversely, we did not find any lower production risk associated with finance provided by farmers' associations and other sources such as family and friends. Results of this study are useful for policy makers, finance providers and supply chain actors in agriculture. For policy makers, the results of this study can help in designing policy to enhance farmers' access to finance, whereas finance providers and supply chain actors, such as traders, obtain insight into whether their financial provisions effectively reduce production risk.",['Farm Friends'],"[{'lastname': 'Wulandari', 'firstname': 'Eliana', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Agriculture, Universitas Padjadjaran, Jatinangor, West Java, Indonesia.'}, {'lastname': 'Meuwissen', 'firstname': 'Miranda P M', 'initials': 'MPM', 'affiliation': 'Business Economics, Wageningen University, Wageningen, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Karmana', 'firstname': 'Maman H', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Agriculture, Universitas Padjadjaran, Jatinangor, West Java, Indonesia.'}, {'lastname': 'Lansink', 'firstname': 'Alfons G J M Oude', 'initials': 'AGJMO', 'affiliation': 'Business Economics, Wageningen University, Wageningen, The Netherlands.'}]",,,10.1371/journal.pone.0257812,PloS one,[],,2021-09-28,34570812,,The role of access to finance from different finance providers in production risks of horticulture in Indonesia.,10
,"This study explores the influence of residency location on the experiences of cancer survivors. The influence of where individuals live during cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment has been described in various countries. However, understanding the context of residency on experiences during survivorship has received less attention.
A survey was designed to assess experiences of cancer survivors transitioning to follow-up care. Descriptive statistics were used to contrast physical, emotional, and practical concerns, help-seeking, and unmet needs of rural and urban dwelling respondents. Difference in proportions of greater than 5% were considered clinically meaningful.
In total, 13,319 respondents completed the survey of which 4646 met the criteria for rural dwelling (e.g., living in villages or towns with 10,000 or less residents or on an acreage, ranch, or farm). Proportions of respondents in rural and urban groups were similar in terms of level of concerns. Differences were observed for help seeking regarding return to work and for difficulty in obtaining help regarding taking care of children and other family members, changes in relationships with family, friends and co-workers, and getting to and from appointments. Unmet needs existed across all domains and were similar in both groups. A larger proportion of rural dwelling respondents experienced unmet needs regarding return to work.

,"This research determines the extent to which farmers benefit from agricultural extension activities and services through realizing higher biological crop yields in the Al-Baha region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Additionally, the nature of the relationship between the personal, economic and social characteristics of farmers and the degree to which they benefit from agricultural extension activities and services are studied.
A simple random sample representing the community of 315 farmers was drawn. Data were collected through a personal interview with a pre-tested questionnaire to satisfy the objectives of the study. Data are subjected to analyses and are interpreted in terms of percentages, arithmetic averages, and standard deviations in addition to the simple Pearson correlation coefficients.
The results show that most of the respondents depend on personal experience, friends, family and neighbors, merchants and sellers of agricultural production supplies as sources of agricultural information for enhanced crop yields. Multiple regression analysis reveals that both the educational status and the agricultural information sources are important factors that increase farmers benefit from extension activities. Farmers receive most benefits from the extension activities and services from bringing in foreign workers, conducting field trips to farms, and identifying problems faced by farmers.
The outcome of this questionnaire limits generalization of the findings for other parts of the Kingdom due to geographical and natural resources variations.
The personal and socio-economic characteristics of the surveyed population provide the extension service with insight into their composition - a basis to formulate workable extension programs. For the extension planners of the area, this effort provides a baseline study and may assist with targeting the appropriate farmers and catering the right solutions to the problems. Such a study will help devise meaningful extension programs and save time and resources.
Little previous research on the usefulness of the Extension Service has been conducted in the region.

,"Successful pharmacy curricula expose students to a variety of teaching and assessment methods to prepare students for clinical practice. However, development of clinical decision-making skills is often challenging for learners. To meet this need, the Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA) Patient Case Format was developed to enhance traditional paper patient cases by integrating problem-based and case-based learning to improve pharmacy student learning. The objectives of this evaluation were to qualitatively evaluate the CYOA case format. The qualitative assessment of the student pharmacist's learning experience utilizing this novel patient case format was used to formulate a template for extrapolation to other disease states.
Focus groups were conducted with second year Pharm.D. students enrolled at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC) College of Pharmacy. The focus groups were conducted in Fall 2020, beginning the week after they were exposed to the CYOA case format. The corpus of data was analyzed thematically to identify themes using inductive coding. To establish the validity of this evaluation, the team met to assess the consistency of the data reduction methods and guard against methodological issues that could influence and affect coding decisions.

,"When compared with more traditional instructional methods, Game-based e-learning (GbEl) promises a higher motivation of learners by presenting contents in an interactive, rule-based and competitive way. Most recent systematic reviews and meta-analysis of studies on Game-based learning and GbEl in the medical professions have shown limited effects of these instructional methods.
To compare the effectiveness on the learning outcome of a Game-based e-learning (GbEl) instruction with a conventional script-based instruction in the teaching of phase contrast microscopy urinalysis under routine training conditions of undergraduate medical students.
A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 145 medical students in their third year of training in the Department of Urology at the University Medical Center Freiburg, Germany. 82 subjects where allocated for training with an educational adventure-game (GbEl group) and 69 subjects for conventional training with a written script-based approach (script group). Learning outcome was measured with a 34 item single choice test. Students' attitudes were collected by a questionnaire regarding fun with the training, motivation to continue the training and self-assessment of acquired knowledge.
The students in the GbEl group achieved significantly better results in the cognitive knowledge test than the students in the script group: the mean score was 28.6 for the GbEl group and 26.0 for the script group of a total of 34.0 points with a Cohen's d effect size of 0.71 (ITT analysis). Attitudes towards the recent learning experience were significantly more positive with GbEl. Students reported to have more fun while learning with the game when compared to the script-based approach.

,"Certain negative factors such as fear, loss of concentration and interest in the course, lack of confidence, and undue stress have been associated with the study of anatomy. These are factors most often provoked by the unusually large curriculum, nature of the course, and the psychosocial impact of dissection. As a palliative measure, Anatomy Adventure, a board game on anatomy was designed to reduce some of these pressures, emphasize student centered and collaborative learning styles, and add fun to the process of learning while promoting understanding and retention of the subject. To assess these objectives, 95 out of over 150 medical and dental students who expressed willingness to be part of the study were recruited and divided into a Game group and a Non-game group. A pretest written examination was given to both groups, participants in the Game group were allowed to play the game for ten days, after which a post-test examination was also given. A 20-item questionnaire rated on a three-point scale to access student's perception of the game was given to the game group. The post-test scores of the game group were significantly higher (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05) than those of the non-game counterparts.

,"Although the use of games as an educational strategy is an important current trend, there is practically no option available for training people on the Drug Discovery and Development (DDD) process. To fill this gap, we designed ""SCREENER"", a science game that is intended to be educational, but also challenging and interesting enough to ensure player engagement. Our main target audience is students of postgraduate programs in pharmacology, medicinal chemistry, pharmacy, and medicine. This game could also be of interest to the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory and patent agencies for training new employees. We discuss the creation of SCREENER, a hybrid of board and card games, and present its components with some examples of cards and resources, as well as the dynamics of the game. SCREENER mimics the process of drug discovery and development from validating a target to registering the new drug with the regulatory agency, and can be played individually (self-learning) or with the help of a monitor who assists up to six players/teams. Briefly, 29 task cards categorized in four major areas (efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmaceutical development) must be purchased sequentially. Classic characteristics of games such as decision making and challenge have been incorporated. More in-depth information on the tasks and technical terms is available through QR codes.

,"The common-sense model of illness suggests that mental representations of health threats may affect one's behavioral reactions to them and health status. Internet gaming disorder is a newly defined mental disorder. Illness representations of internet gaming disorder may affect one's risk of internet gaming disorder. In turn, symptoms of internet gaming disorder may affect one's perceptions of the disorder.
This study aimed to investigate the relationships between illness representations and symptoms of internet gaming disorder in college students.
A 1-year longitudinal study was conducted with a convenience sample of Chinese college students (n=591; 342/591, 57.9% female).
Of the participants, 10.1% (60/591) and 9.1% (54/591) were classified as having probable internet gaming disorder at baseline (T1) and follow-up (T2), respectively. The correlations between some dimensions of illness representations regarding internet gaming disorder (ie, consequence, timeline, personal control, treatment control, and concern) at T1 and symptoms of internet gaming disorder at T2 and between symptoms of internet gaming disorder at T1 and the dimensions of illness representations at T2 (ie, consequence, timeline, personal control, and emotional response) were statistically significant. The cross-lagged model fit the data well ((œá

,"Leveraging elements of game design and theories of human motivation, gamification provides a variety of techniques to engage learners in novel ways. Our Clinical and Translational Science Award created the software platform (Kaizen-Education¬©) to deliver gamified educational content in 2012. Here, we explore two novel use cases of this platform to provide practical insights for leveraging these methods in educational settings: (1) national training in rigor, reproducibility, and transparency and (2) attainment of learner competency (n = 7) as a gauge of curricular effectiveness across Master of Public Health degree tracks (n = 5). Data were captured in real time during player interaction with Kaizen-Education¬© to provide descriptive analyses of player engagement in both implementation examples. We then assessed item analysis to assess knowledge gain and competency attainment. We have just begun to leverage the potential for gamification to engage learners, enhance knowledge acquisition, and document completion of training, across various learning environments. We encourage a systematic approach to gamification applying insights from self-determination theory to learners and learning environments, a methodical approach to game design and rigorous analysis after implementation to generate evidence-based insights to maximize educational return for time invested.",['Kid-E-Cats.

,"The aim of this study is to define the anatomical localization of corresponding brain function area during calculating. The activating modes in brain during continuous silent calculating subtraction and repeated silent reading multiplication table were compared and investigated. Fourteen volunteers of right-handedness were enrolled in this experiment. The quite different reaction models in brain area during the two models of calculation revealed that there are different processing pathways in brain during these two operating tasks. During continuous silent calculating, the function areas were found localized on the posterior portion of superior and middle gyrus of frontal lobe and the lobule of posterior parietal lobe (P < 0.01, T = 5.41), demonstrating that these function areas play an important role in the performance of calculation and working memory. During repeated silent reading multiplication table, the activating cluster was found only located in in the gyri occipital lateral(P < 0.01, T = 4.77).",['Multiplication table.

,"By using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the neural substrates involved in mental recitation of the single-digit multiplication table and serial subtraction were studied. The former depends mostly on well-learned arithmetical facts, while the latter requires arithmetic processing. Activation during each task was compared with that in a number counting control. During the recitation of single-digit multiplication, the activated regions included the area lying along the left intraparietal sulcus, the premotor and supplementary motor areas, and the posterior portion of the left inferior frontal gyrus. The areas activated during serial subtraction included these areas as well as the bilateral prefrontal and right parietal areas. From the results obtained during retrieval of the multiplication table in this study and previous studies, it was concluded that semantic memory of the multiplication table is stored in the area lying along the intraparietal sulcus and that the frontal areas play an executive role in utilizing the semantic memory of arithmetical facts. It was assumed that the arithmetical facts requiring actual calculation are also stored in the same region. The additional activation during serial subtraction compared with the activation during retrieval of the multiplication table is probably due to the processes of actual calculation. These processes include proper alignment of digits, which may have caused the right parietal activation, and maintaining digits needed for the mental serial subtractions, which may have caused the bilateral prefrontal activation.",['Multiplication table.

,"Health games provide opportunities for the treatment and prevention of childhood obesity. We developed a motion-controlled serious game for children that addresses 3 core topics of nutrition, physical activity, and stress coping. It is the first serious game that extensively targets the dietary energy density principle (DED-P) in relation to nutrition. The game is intended to provide an additional educational component for the prevention and treatment of obesity in children.
The Kids Obesity Prevention study aimed to evaluate the newly developed game and to evaluate how well children are able to understand and apply the DED-P.
This cluster randomized controlled trial collected data from 82 primary school children aged 9 to 12 years and their parents at baseline (T0), at 2 weeks after study commencement (T1), and at the 4-week follow-up (T2). The dropout rate was 3.6%. The intervention group (IG) played the game within 2 weeks (2 sessions with different game modules). One part of the game involves selection of food with the lower energy density when presented with a pair of foods. This allows assessment of whether the children have understood the DED-P and whether they can apply it to unknown foods under time pressure. The control group (CG) received a brochure about the food pyramid concept and physical activity. The primary outcome was the gain in knowledge (nutrition and stress coping) and measured with a pretested questionnaire. The secondary outcomes were the maintenance of knowledge, application of the DED-P, feelings during game play, game acceptance, and behavioral measures (physical activity, media consumption, and dietary intake).
The knowledge score ranging from 0 to 100 increased from T0 (IG: 53 [SD 10], CG: 50 [SD 11]) to T1 (IG: 69 [SD 11], CG: 52 [SD 12]) in IG versus CG (P<.001). At T2, the knowledge score of IG remained at the same level as that of T1. Game data showed that after DED-P education, the classification under time pressure of unknown versus known food pairs according to their DED category was similar (hit rate around 70%). Overall, 95% of the children liked the game very much or much. No group changes were observed at the behavioral level.
The Kids Obesity Prevention program sustainably increased knowledge in the areas of nutrition and stress coping, and children were able to apply the DED-P.

,"The prevention of obesity and improvement of academic achievement in children are concerns of industrialized societies. Obesity has been associated with psychological disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, whose prevalence has been estimated at 6.8 % in Spanish children and adolescents. It is known that physical activity is positively related to academic achievement and negatively related to the risk of obesity in children. However, studies to test the effectiveness of physical activity interventions in improving academic achievement in preschool children are scarce and have some weaknesses that threaten their validity. Moreover, very few studies have examined their effectiveness in improving symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. This paper outlines a two-year multidimensional preschool intervention (Movi-Kids) aimed at preventing obesity and improving academic achievement in children with or without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
Twenty-one schools from Ciudad Real and Cuenca, Spain, were randomized to intervention and control groups. In the first academic year, children in the third grade of preschool and the first grade of primary school in the intervention group received the Movi-Kids intervention. In the second academic year, schools were crossed over to the other group. The intervention included children, parents and teachers, and the school environment, and consisted of: (i) three hour-long sessions of recreational non-competitive physical activity after school, weekly, (ii) educational materials for parents and teachers addressing sedentary lifestyle risks and (iii) playground modifications to promote physical activity during breaks. Primary outcome measures of this study were academic achievement (intelligence, cognition, memory, attention and perception), assessed by the Battery of General and Differential Aptitudes, and adiposity measures (body mass index, waist circumference, triceps skinfold thickness and body fat percentage). Secondary outcome measures were: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder risk, motor skills, health-related quality of life and sleep quality. These variables will all be measured in both groups at baseline and at the end of the first and second academic years.
It seems reasonable that an intervention to promote physical activity based on playground games will be useful for simultaneously improving academic achievement and controlling obesity.

,"Children in households of lower socioeconomic status (SES) are more likely to be overweight/obese. We aimed to determine if home physical activity (PA) environments differed by SES and to explore home environment mediators of the relation of family SES to children's PA and sedentary behavior.
Participants were 715 children aged 6 to 11 from the Neighborhood Impact on Kids (NIK) Study. Household SES was examined using highest educational attainment and income. Home environment was measured by parent report on a survey. Outcomes were child's accelerometer-measured PA and parent-reported screen time. Mediation analyses were conducted for home environment factors that varied by SES.
Children from lower income households had greater media access in their bedrooms (TV 52% vs. 14%, DVD player 39% vs. 14%, video games 21% vs. 9%) but lower access to portable play equipment (bikes 85% vs. 98%, jump ropes 69% vs. 83%) compared to higher income children. Lower SES families had more restrictive rules about PA (2.5 vs. 2.0). Across SES, children watched TV/DVDs with parents/siblings more often than they engaged in PA with them. Parents of lower SES watched TV/DVDs with their children more often (3.1 vs. 2.5‚Äâdays/week). Neither total daily and home-based MVPA nor sedentary time differed by SES. Children's daily screen time varied from 1.7 hours/day in high SES to 2.4 in low SES families. Media in the bedroom was related to screen time, and screen time with parents was a mediator of the SES--screen time relationship.

,"Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating disease affecting preterm infants, with little improvement in mortality rates and treatment strategies in the last 30 years. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are emerging as a potential preventive therapy, with multiple protective functions postulated. Our aim is to summarise the evidence concerning the role of HMOs in NEC development and emerging strategies to tailor the delivery of HMOs to preterm infants. Most research efforts to date have focused on supplementing preterm infants with simple oligosaccharides, which are structurally different to HMOs and derived mainly from plants. Clinical trials demonstrate limited benefits for NEC prevention arising from the use of these supplements. Alternative strategies under investigation include optimising HMOs for infants receiving donor human milk, concentrating oligosaccharides from donor human milk and from animal milks, as well as more sophisticated synthetic oligosaccharide production strategies. Critically, high quality evidence to support implementation of any of these approaches in the neonatal unit is lacking. Whether it is a specific HMO alone or a combination of HMOs that exert protective effects remains to be elucidated. Further challenges include how best to manufacture and administer oligosaccharides whilst retaining bioactivity and safety, including evaluation of the long-term effects of altering the balance of HMOs and gut microbiota in preterm infants. While several human clinical trials are underway, further research is needed to understand whether a tailored approach to oligosaccharide supplementation is beneficial for preterm infants.",['Tailor Kids'],"[{'lastname': 'Abbas', 'firstname': 'Safiyyah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Women's and Children's Health Network, Adelaide, SA, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Keir', 'firstname': 'Amy K', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': ""Women's and Children's Health Network, Adelaide, SA, Australia.\nSAHMRI Women and Kids, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia.\nAdelaide Medical School, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.\nRobinson Research Institute, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Makrides', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'SAHMRI Women and Kids, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia.\nRobinson Research Institute, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Klein', 'firstname': 'Laura D', 'initials': 'LD', 'affiliation': 'Business Growth and Innovation, Australian Red Cross Lifeblood, Sydney, NSW, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Grzeskowiak', 'firstname': 'Luke E', 'initials': 'LE', 'affiliation': 'SAHMRI Women and Kids, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia.\nCollege of Medicine and Public Health, Flinders University, Adelaide, SA, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'McPhee', 'firstname': 'Andrew J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'SAHMRI Women and Kids, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Rumbold', 'firstname': 'Alice R', 'initials': 'AR', 'affiliation': 'SAHMRI Women and Kids, South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia.\nAdelaide Medical School, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.\nRobinson Research Institute, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia.'}]",,"Copyright ¬© 2021 Abbas, Keir, Makrides, Klein, Grzeskowiak, McPhee and Rumbold.",10.3389/fnut.2021.702888,Frontiers in nutrition,"['breast milk', 'necrotising enterocolitis', 'neonatal nutrition', 'oligosaccharides', 'preterm (birth)', 'very low birth weight infants']",,2021-08-17,34395496,,Tailoring Human Milk Oligosaccharides to Prevent Necrotising Enterocolitis Among Preterm Infants.,10
,"Youth mental health problems are a major public health concern. Anxiety and depression are among the most common psychological difficulties. The aim of this study is to evaluate an optimized version of a promising indicated group intervention for emotional problems. The program (EMOTION Coping Kids Managing Anxiety and Depression) targets school children 8-12¬†years with anxious and depressive symptoms and examines three factors. Factor 1 compares the standard EMOTION intervention delivered in 16 group-based sessions (Group), versus a partially-digital EMOTION intervention (DIGGI) delivered as eight group sessions and eight digital sessions. Both versions use virtual reality technology (VR) to improve behavioral experiments. Factor 2 compares parent participation in a 5-session parent group (high involvement) versus sharing information with parents via a brochure (low involvement). Factor 3 compares the use of a measurement and feedback system (MFS) designed to help group leaders tailor the intervention using feedback from children with no MFS.
Using a cluster-randomized factorial design, 40 schools across Norway will be randomized to eight different experimental conditions based on three, two-level factors. To assess internalizing symptoms in children, children and their parents will be given self-report questionnaires pre-, post-, and one year after intervention. Parents also report on demographics, user satisfaction, personal symptoms and perception of family related factors. Teachers report on child symptoms and school functioning. Group leaders and the head of the municipal services report on implementation issues. The primary outcomes are changes in depressive and anxious symptoms. Some secondary outcomes are changes in self-esteem, quality of life, and user satisfaction. Questions regarding the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are included. Treatment fidelity is based on checklists from group leaders, and on user data from the participating children.
This study is a collaboration between three regional centers for child and adolescent mental health in Norway.

,"Objectives The aim of this study was to generate a conceptual framework describing which aspects of children and adolescents' lives are affected by chronic tinnitus. Design Views and experiences of 32 participants from two participant groups informed this study: (a) a tinnitus group, consisting of adults who had experienced tinnitus during childhood and/or adolescence and primary carers of children/adolescents with tinnitus, and (b) a clinicians' group, consisting of clinicians who provided care for children/adolescents with tinnitus. Participants produced statements describing aspects of children/adolescents' lives that may be affected by chronic tinnitus. Key concepts were identified through the processes of sorting the statements and rating them for degree of associated impact. Result Participants identified 118 unique aspects of the lives of children/adolescents who may be affected by chronic tinnitus. These were clustered into four concepts: (a) emotional well-being, (b) academic performances, (c) social/relationa, and (d) auditory/cognitive processing. At a group level, participants rated the impact of tinnitus as above a slight degree but below a moderate degree of impact. However, individual participant's ratings indicated a range of perceived impact for each statement. Conclusions The experience of chronic tinnitus during childhood and adolescence extends beyond the mere perception of sound. The perception of tinnitus may impact a child's emotional well-being, academic performances, social/relational, and auditory/cognitive processing. The impact of tinnitus in one aspect of a child's life may influence other aspects of their life. While at a group level, participants regarded the impact of tinnitus as ""somewhat more than mild"" to ""less than moderate""; individual participant's ratings indicate that the impact from chronic tinnitus may be highly individual and highlighted the importance of individual assessment and management. Clinically, tinnitus management during childhood and adolescence may be improved if clinicians consider the impact and manifestation of tinnitus within each child's daily life and tailor tinnitus education and management strategies accordingly.",['Tailor Kids'],"[{'lastname': 'Tegg-Quinn', 'firstname': 'Susan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Ear Science Institute Australia, Subiaco, Western Australia, Australia.\nEar Sciences Centre, The University of Western Australia, Nedlands, Australia.\nSchool of Human Sciences, The University of Western Australia, Nedlands, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Eikelboom', 'firstname': 'Robert H', 'initials': 'RH', 'affiliation': 'Ear Science Institute Australia, Subiaco, Western Australia, Australia.\nEar Sciences Centre, The University of Western Australia, Nedlands, Australia.\nDepartment of Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology, University of Pretoria, South Africa.'}, {'lastname': 'Brennan-Jones', 'firstname': 'Christopher G', 'initials': 'CG', 'affiliation': ""Ear Health Group, Telethon Kids Institute, The University of Western Australia, Nedlands, Australia.\nDivision of Paediatrics, School of Medicine, The University of Western Australia, Nedlands, Australia.\nDepartment of Audiology, Perth Children's Hospital, Western Australia, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Barabash', 'firstname': 'Syndon', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Syndon Barabash, Malvern, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Mulders', 'firstname': 'Wilhelmina H A M', 'initials': 'WHAM', 'affiliation': 'School of Human Sciences, The University of Western Australia, Nedlands, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Bennett', 'firstname': 'Rebecca J', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': 'Ear Science Institute Australia, Subiaco, Western Australia, Australia.\nEar Sciences Centre, The University of Western Australia, Nedlands, Australia.'}]",,,10.1044/2021_AJA-20-00178,American journal of audiology,[],,2021-06-18,34139128,,Reflections on How Tinnitus Impacts the Lives of Children and Adolescents.,10

,"What are the key considerations for developing an enhanced transcriptomic method for secretory endometrial tissue dating?
Multiple gene expression signature combinations can serve as biomarkers for endometrial dating, but their predictive performance is variable and depends on the number and identity of the genes included in the prediction model, the dataset characteristics and the technology employed for measuring gene expression.
Among the new generation of transcriptomic endometrial dating (TED) tools developed in the last decade, there exists variation in the technology used for measuring gene expression, the gene makeup and the prediction model design. A detailed study, comparing prediction performance across signatures for understanding signature behaviour and discrepancies in gene content between them, is lacking.
A multicentre prospective study was performed between July 2018 and October 2020 at five different centres from the same group of clinics (Spain). This study recruited 281 patients and finally included in the gene expression analysis 225 Caucasian patients who underwent IVF treatment. After preprocessing and batch effect filtering, gene expression measurements from 217 patients were combined with artificial intelligence algorithms (support vector machine, random forest and k-nearest neighbours) allowing evaluation of different prediction models. In addition, secretory-phase endometrial transcriptomes from gene expression omnibus (GEO) datasets were analysed for 137 women, to study the endometrial dating capacity of genes independently and grouped by signatures. This provided data on the consistency of prediction across different gene expression technologies and datasets.
Endometrial biopsies were analysed using a targeted TruSeq (Illumina) custom RNA expression panel called the endometrial dating panel (ED panel). This panel included 301 genes previously considered relevant for endometrial dating as well as new genes selected for their anticipated value in detecting the secretory phase. Final samples (n = 217) were divided into a training set for signature discovery and an independent testing set for evaluation of predictive performance of the new signature. In addition, secretory-phase endometrial transcriptomes from GEO were analysed for 137 women to study endometrial dating capacity of genes independently and grouped by signatures. Predictive performance among these signatures was compared according to signature gene set size.
Testing of the ED panel allowed development of a model based on a new signature of 73 genes, which we termed 'TED' and delivers an enhanced tool for the consistent dating of the secretory phase progression, especially during the mid-secretory endometrium (3-8 days after progesterone (P) administration (P + 3-P + 8) in a hormone replacement therapy cycle). This new model showed the best predictive capacity in an independent test set for staging the endometrial tissue in the secretory phase, especially in the expected window of implantation (average of 114.5 ¬± 7.2 h of progesterone administered; range in our patient population of 82-172 h). Published sets of genes, in current use for endometrial dating and the new TED genes, were evaluated in parallel in whole-transcriptome datasets and in the ED panel dataset. TED signature performance was consistently excellent for all datasets assessed, frequently outperforming previously published sets of genes with a smaller number of genes for dating the endometrium in the secretory phase. Thus, this optimized set exhibited prediction consistency across datasets.
The data used in this study is partially available at GEO database. GEO identifiers GSE4888, GSE29981, GSE58144, GSE98386.
Although dating the endometrial biopsy is crucial for investigating endometrial progression and the receptivity process, further studies are needed to confirm whether or not endometrial dating methods in general are clinically useful and to guide the specific use of TED in the clinical setting.
Multiple gene signature combinations provide adequate endometrial dating, but their predictive performance depends on the identity of the genes included, the gene expression platform, the algorithms used and dataset characteristics. TED is a next-generation endometrial assessment tool based on gene expression for accurate endometrial progression dating especially during the mid-secretory.

,"The World Psychiatric Association (WPA), a global association representing 145 psychiatric societies in 121 countries, has a specific focus on education and learning, promoting educational programs on a regular basis. Education in mental health is a continuously evolving phenomenon, although it happens quite often that it is still based on a knowledge formed in the last century and with the latest scientific updates mainly available in English. The WPA is constantly committed in improving and updating the type of educational materials available and ready to be disseminated worldwide.
An online survey has been developed and sent to the 18 WPA zonal representatives in order: to evaluate the educational needs for mental health, to translate materials into native languages or inclusivity, and to prioritize educational activities to be developed by the WPA in the next years.
Fifteen out of the 18 zonal representatives participated in the study. According to the public mental health perspective, collaboration with general practitioners (GPs) (80%), communities/stakeholders (66.7%) and programs for promoting mental health in schools (53.3%) are the most prioritized activities carried out. Programs for suicide prevention (86.7%) and promotion of mental health and well-being in the general population (66.7%) are considered as the most relevant to be implemented. From the healthcare perspective, new knowledge on pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions (73%) was requested. The educational packages are mostly available in the English language, although respondents prioritize the translation of WPA educational material into, at least, Spanish and French. The most preferred formats for educational activities are webinar live (80%) and key opinion lectures (66.7%).
These findings represent the first step in the continuing promotion of education carried out by the WPA.

,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented health crisis. Pressure on the National Health System has created unique demand particularly in certain services and care units like the critical care units.
To learn about the experience of nurses in caring for people with coronavirus in critical care units.
A qualitative phenomenological study that constitutes the second phase of a mixed methodology project. We conducted interviews with 17 nurses caring for patients affected by COVID-19 in critical care units. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analysed using thematic discourse analysis.
This article shows the findings around the theme ""the value of human resources"" which is nuanced through sub-themes ""it's not the beds, it's the expert staff"", ""shouldering the patient's burden"", and suffering because ""they have not cared well"".
Expert nurses have emerged as leading professionals in the care of the critical patient during the COVID-19 pandemic. This leadership is executed from a profile framed in an inclusive philosophy where wisdom, agility and intuition are the key elements underpinning problem identification and solving in a creative way, while adapting to the needs of the patient and healthcare team as they emerge.
Expert nurses have played an advanced role in the management of care and human resources by exercising effective leadership in the clinical setting. Care has been hampered due to the crisis, which causes nurses moral distress because they have been unable to meet standards of quality and excellence in care.",['Learn Spanish with SpeakTribe'],"[{'lastname': 'Gonz√°lez-Gil', 'firstname': 'M T', 'initials': 'MT', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Enfermer√≠a, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid, Madrid, Espa√±a.'}, {'lastname': 'Oter-Quintana', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Enfermer√≠a, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid, Madrid, Espa√±a.'}, {'lastname': 'Mart√≠nez-Marcos', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Enfermer√≠a, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid, Madrid, Espa√±a.'}, {'lastname': 'Alcolea-Cos√≠n', 'firstname': 'M T', 'initials': 'MT', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Enfermer√≠a, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid, Madrid, Espa√±a.'}, {'lastname': 'Navarta-S√°nchez', 'firstname': 'M V', 'initials': 'MV', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Enfermer√≠a, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid, Madrid, Espa√±a.'}, {'lastname': 'Robledo-Mart√≠n', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Enfermer√≠a, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid, Madrid, Espa√±a.'}, {'lastname': 'Palmar-Santos', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Enfermer√≠a, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid, Madrid, Espa√±a.'}, {'lastname': 'Pedraz-Marcos', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Enfermer√≠a, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid, Madrid, Espa√±a.'}, {'lastname': 'Gonz√°lez-Bl√°zquez', 'firstname': 'C', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Enfermer√≠a, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid, Madrid, Espa√±a.'}, {'lastname': 'Parro-Moreno', 'firstname': 'A I', 'initials': 'AI', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Enfermer√≠a, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid, Madrid, Espa√±a.'}, {'lastname': 'Otero-Garc√≠a', 'firstname': 'L', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Departamento de Enfermer√≠a, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid, Madrid, Espa√±a.'}]",,"¬© 2021 Sociedad Espa√±ola de Enfermer√≠a Intensiva y Unidades Coronarias (SEEIUC).

,"Recent advances in information technology (IT) provided us with novel teaching solutions, with the potential of a new enhanced learning experience, that is, more adapted to the needs and preferences of the younger generations of psychiatric trainees. These tools include the use of online/virtual whiteboards, live surveys/polls, live quizzes, virtual classrooms, and virtual reality. In the present paper, we describe the implementation of modern technology in psychiatric training in Tunisia, a North-African middle-income country. We discuss the potential benefits arising from this implementation, and we report the challenges and difficulties. Overall, the implementation of these modern technology-based tools in psychiatric training has been successful, with a very few obstacles. It seems that the integration of these novel approaches is possible even in middle and low-income countries without much hassle. These tools can enhance trainees' participation, motivation, and engagement, thereby potentially improving learning outcomes. Most disadvantages are related to potential technical glitches, and are likely to improve as technology progresses. Teaching is the art of tailoring the educational tools to the learning objectives and to the learners' characteristics and preferences. To achieve optimal learning outcomes, it is often needed to use a mixture of different ""modern"" and ""less modern"" techniques.",['English Quiz [Eigomonogatari]'],"[{'lastname': 'Ouanes', 'firstname': 'Sami', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Razi University Hospital, Manouba, Tunisia.\nDepartment of Psychiatry, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.'}, {'lastname': 'Larnaout', 'firstname': 'Amine', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Razi University Hospital, Manouba, Tunisia.'}, {'lastname': 'Jouini', 'firstname': 'Lamia', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychiatry, Razi University Hospital, Manouba, Tunisia.\nDepartment of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Valais Hospital, Valais, Switzerland.'}]",,"¬© 2021 The Authors.

,"Predicting students at risk of academic failure is valuable for higher education institutions to improve student performance. During the pandemic, with the transition to compulsory distance learning in higher education, it has become even more important to identify these students and make instructional interventions to avoid leaving them behind. This goal can be achieved by new data mining techniques and machine learning methods. This study took both the synchronous and asynchronous activity characteristics of students into account to identify students at risk of academic failure during the pandemic. Additionally, this study proposes an optimal ensemble model predicting students at risk using a combination of relevant machine learning algorithms. Performances of over two thousand university students were predicted with an ensemble model in terms of gender, degree, number of downloaded lecture notes and course materials, total time spent in online sessions, number of attendances, and quiz score. Asynchronous learning activities were found more determinant than synchronous ones. The proposed ensemble model made a good prediction with a specificity of 90.34%.

,"Blood cultures are the most significant samples received in a microbiology laboratory. Good quality control of pre-analytic, analytic, and post-analytic stages can have a significant impact on patient outcomes. Here, we present the improvements brought about by reviewing blood culture data with clinicians at a tertiary care institute in India.
Four-year blood culture data (phase I-February 2014-February 2018) were shared with clinicians in the clinical grand round. Several take-home messages were discussed in a quiz format, and a number of holistic quality control measures were implemented at different levels. Based on observable changes in blood culture reports, another dataset was analyzed and compared in phase II (April 2018-April 2019).
In phase II, the blood culture contamination rate improved from 6 to 2% along with four times reduction in ICU isolates and three times increased isolation of salmonellae and pneumococci. The development of resistance in 
Reviewing blood culture data with clinicians mutually helped us to improve the overall quality of blood culture reports. It had a major impact on epidemiological trends and thus, found to be superior to just sharing an antibiogram with the clinicians.

,"To determine the amount of daily screen time in children 18‚ÄÖmonths of age and ascertain correlations that may be contributing to excessive screen use.
A birth cohort was followed with telephone interviews at 6, 12 and 18‚ÄÖmonths of age. Information about screen time was collected at 18‚ÄÖmonths.
Parents were recruited from postnatal wards of 2 major public hospitals and at home visits conducted for new mothers within 4‚ÄÖweeks of birth in South Western Sydney (SWS).
Parents of 500 children with infants 18‚ÄÖmonths of age residing in SWS.
Screen time in infants 18‚ÄÖmonths of age and associated correlations.
A large percentage of children 18‚ÄÖmonths of age (40%) had screen times >2‚ÄÖhours daily. There were significant associations between more than 2‚ÄÖhours of screen time daily and mothers without a partner (OR 4.32 (95% CI 1.67 to 11.15)); having <3 siblings (no siblings: OR 2.44 (95% CI 1.20 to 4.94); 1-2 siblings: OR 2.08 (95% CI 1.06 to 4.08)); an employed father (OR 1.96 (95% CI 1.09 to 3.52)); no outdoor equipment at home (OR 1.89 (95% CI 1.08 to 3.34)) and fewer than 5 outings per week (OR 2.08 (95% CI 1.37 to 3.17)).
There is emerging evidence that excess screen time in children causes adverse cognitive, developmental and health outcomes. This study has shown that a large proportion of very young children residing in SWS have screen exposures for >2‚ÄÖhours per day. Factors contributing to excess screen time have also been identified in this study; however, a greater understanding of risk factors needs to be ascertained in order to facilitate greater public health efforts to reduce screen exposure.","['Baby Phone - Games for Family, Parents and Babies']","[{'lastname': 'Chandra', 'firstname': 'Meena', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Community Paediatrics, South Western Sydney Local Health District, Liverpool, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Jalaludin', 'firstname': 'Bin', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Epidemiology Group, Healthy People and Places Unit, South Western Sydney Local Health District, Liverpool, New South Wales, Australia.\nIngham Institute for Applied Medical Research, Liverpool, New South Wales, Australia.\nSchool of Public Health and Community Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Woolfenden', 'firstname': 'Susan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Sydney Children's Hospitals Network, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia.\nUniversity of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Descallar', 'firstname': 'Joseph', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Ingham Institute for Applied Medical Research, Liverpool, New South Wales, Australia.\nSouth Western Sydney Clinical School, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Nicholls', 'firstname': 'Laura', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Academic Unit of Child Psychiatry South Western Sydney Local Health District (AUCS), Liverpool, New South Wales, Australia.\nSchool of Psychiatry & Ingham Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Dissanayake', 'firstname': 'Cheryl', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Olga Tennison Autism Research Centre, La Trobe University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Williams', 'firstname': 'Katrina', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': ""Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.\nDevelopmental Medicine, Royal Children's Hospital, Australia.\nMurdoch Children's Research Institute, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Murphy', 'firstname': 'Elisabeth', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'NSW Kids and Families, NSW Ministry of Health, North Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Walter', 'firstname': 'Amelia', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.\nAcademic Unit of Child Psychiatry South Western Sydney Local Health District (AUCS), Liverpool, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Eastwood', 'firstname': 'John', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Community Paediatrics, South Western Sydney Local Health District, Liverpool, New South Wales, Australia.\nIngham Institute for Applied Medical Research, Liverpool, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Eapen', 'firstname': 'Valsamma', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Ingham Institute for Applied Medical Research, Liverpool, New South Wales, Australia.\nAcademic Unit of Child Psychiatry South Western Sydney Local Health District (AUCS), Liverpool, New South Wales, Australia.\nSchool of Psychiatry & Ingham Institute, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Telephone survey administered to 1454 parents of children <11 years old derived from a diverse clinic population.
The mean age of the index child was 5.05 years. Mean daily reported child media use was as follows: television (1.45 hours; SD, 1.5); videos (1.1 hours; SD, 1.30); and computer games (0.54 hours; SD, 0.96). Thirty percent of parents reported that their child ate breakfast or dinner in front of the television in the past week, and 22% were concerned about the amount of television that their child watched. In multivariate linear regression, eating breakfast or dinner in front of the television in the past week was associated with increased hours of television viewing (0.38 hours [0.21, 0.54]) and video (0.19 hours [0.04, 0.34]). Having a television in a child's bedroom was associated with increased hours of television (0.25 hours [0.07, 0.43]), video viewing (0.31 hours [0.16, 0.47]), and computer games (0.21 hours [0.10, 0.32]). In general, higher parental education was associated with decreased hours of television and video but not computer games. Older children were 2 to 3 times more likely than younger children to have a television in their bedroom and to have eaten a meal in front of it in the past week. More educated parents were less likely to report that their child had a television in their bedroom and more likely to be concerned about the amount of television their child viewed.
Combined video and computer game usage exceeded television usage. Both children of low- and high-income parents are at risk for certain behaviors associated with television usage.

,"The ability to use word category information (WCI) for syntactic structure building has been hypothesized to be the essence of human language faculty. The neural substrate of the ability of using the WCI for the complex syntactic hierarchical structure processing, however, is yet unknown. Therefore, we directly conducted an fMRI experiment by using a pseudo-Chinese artificial language with syntactic structures containing a center-embedded relative clause. Thirty non-Chinese native (Korean) speakers were randomly divided into two groups: one acquired WCI and WCI-based syntactic rules (the WCI group) before the scanning session, and the other did not (the non-WCI group). Both groups were required to judge the grammaticality of the testing sentences, with critical long-distance dependencies between two elements (the main verb and the relativizer). Behaviorally, the WCI group's accuracy was significantly higher and its reaction time was shorter. The scanning results showed that the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) and Broca's area were more strongly activated for the WCI group, and the dynamic causal modeling analyses revealed a distinct effective connectivity pattern for this group. Therefore, the present research, for the first time, reveals that the activation of and the functional connectivity between Broca's area and the left STG play a critical role in the ability of the rule-based use of the WCI which is crucial for complex hierarchical structure building, and might be substantially corresponding to the ""labeling competence"" within the linguistic framework.",['Learn Korean - Language & Grammar Learning'],"[{'lastname': 'Chen', 'firstname': 'Luyao', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'College of Chinese Language and Culture, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.\nDepartment of Neuropsychology, Max Plank Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Wu', 'firstname': 'Junjie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Fu', 'firstname': 'Yongben', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Kang', 'firstname': 'Huntae', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'College of Chinese Language and Culture, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Feng', 'firstname': 'Liping', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'College of Chinese Language and Culture, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.'}]",,"¬© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/hbm.24386,Human brain mapping,"['artificial grammar', 'complex hierarchical syntactic structure', 'dynamic causal modeling', 'fMRI', 'labeling competence', 'rule-based', 'word category information']",,2018-09-22,30240492,,Neural substrates of word category information as the basis of syntactic processing.,7
,"Language learning requires linguistic input, but several studies have found that knowledge of second language (L2) rules does not seem to improve with more language exposure (e.g., Johnson & Newport, 1989). One reason for this is that previous studies did not factor out variation due to the different rules tested. To examine this issue, we reanalyzed grammaticality judgment scores in Flege, Yeni-Komshian, and Liu's (1999) study of L2 learners using rule-related predictors and found that, in addition to the overall drop in performance due to a sensitive period, L2 knowledge increased with years of input. Knowledge of different grammar rules was negatively associated with input frequency of those rules. To better understand these effects, we modeled the results using a connectionist model that was trained using Korean as a first language (L1) and then English as an L2. To explain the sensitive period in L2 learning, the model's learning rate was reduced in an age-related manner. By assigning different learning rates for syntax and lexical learning, we were able to model the difference between early and late L2 learners in input sensitivity. The model's learning mechanism allowed transfer between the L1 and L2, and this helped to explain the differences between different rules in the grammaticality judgment task. This work demonstrates that an L1 model of learning and processing can be adapted to provide an explicit account of how the input and the sensitive period interact in L2 learning.",['Learn Korean - Language & Grammar Learning'],"[{'lastname': 'Janciauskas', 'firstname': 'Marius', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, The University of Liverpool.'}, {'lastname': 'Chang', 'firstname': 'Franklin', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, The University of Liverpool.'}]",,"Copyright ¬© 2017 The Authors.

,"A fundamental question in the study of human language acquisition centers around apportioning explanatory force between the experience of the learner and the core knowledge that allows learners to represent that experience. We provide a previously unidentified kind of data identifying children's contribution to language acquisition. We identify one aspect of grammar that varies unpredictably across a population of speakers of what is ostensibly a single language. We further demonstrate that the grammatical knowledge of parents and their children is independent. The combination of unpredictable variation and parent-child independence suggests that the relevant structural feature is supplied by each learner independent of experience with the language. This structural feature is abstract because it controls variation in more than one construction. The particular case we examine is the position of the verb in the clause structure of Korean. Because Korean is a head-final language, evidence for the syntactic position of the verb is both rare and indirect. We show that (i) Korean speakers exhibit substantial variability regarding this aspect of the grammar, (ii) this variability is attested between speakers but not within a speaker, (iii) this variability controls interpretation in two surface constructions, and (iv) it is independent in parents and children. According to our findings, when the exposure language is compatible with multiple grammars, learners acquire a single systematic grammar. Our observation that children and their parents vary independently suggests that the choice of grammar is driven in part by a process operating internal to individual learners.

,"The aim of this study was to characterize the effects of topiramate on language functions in newly diagnosed pediatric epileptic patients.
Thirty-eight newly diagnosed epileptic patients were assessed using standard language tests.

We used language tests in the Korean version because all the patients were spoken Korean exclusively in their families.

,"This longitudinal study tracked the neuro-cognitive changes associated with second language (L2) grammar learning in adults in order to investigate how L2 processing is shaped by a learner's first language (L1) background and L2 proficiency. Previous studies using event-related potentials (ERPs) have argued that late L2 learners cannot elicit a P600 in response to L2 grammatical structures that do not exist in the L1 or that are different in the L1 and L2. We tested whether the neuro-cognitive processes underlying this component become available after intensive L2 instruction. Korean- and Chinese late-L2-learners of English were tested at the beginning and end of a 9-week intensive English-L2 course. ERPs were recorded while participants read English sentences containing violations of regular past tense (a grammatical structure that operates differently in Korean and does not exist in Chinese). Whereas no P600 effects were present at the start of instruction, by the end of instruction, significant P600s were observed for both L1 groups. Latency differences in the P600 exhibited by Chinese and Korean speakers may be attributed to differences in L1-L2 reading strategies. Across all participants, larger P600 effects at session 2 were associated with: 1) higher levels of behavioural performance on an online grammaticality judgment task; and 2) with correct, rather than incorrect, behavioural responses. These findings suggest that the neuro-cognitive processes underlying the P600 (e.g., ""grammaticalization"") are modulated by individual levels of L2 behavioural performance and learning.",['Learn Korean - Language & Grammar Learning'],"[{'lastname': 'White', 'firstname': 'Erin Jacquelyn', 'initials': 'EJ', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Research on Brain, Language and Music, Montreal, Canada. erin.white@mail.mcgill.ca'}, {'lastname': 'Genesee', 'firstname': 'Fred', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Steinhauer', 'firstname': 'Karsten', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1371/journal.pone.0052318,PloS one,[],,2013-01-10,23300641,,Brain responses before and after intensive second language learning: proficiency based changes and first language background effects in adult learners.,7

,"Previous studies have found that emotion has significant influence on the learning of foreign language vocabulary and textual comprehension. However, little attention has been given to the effect of induced emotion on grammar learning. This research examined the influence of positive induced emotion on the learning of Japanese grammatical rules among a group of learners with Chinese as their native language, using a semi-artificial language (i.e. Chipanese), which combines the grammatical rules of Japanese and the vocabulary of Chinese. Music was used to invoke positive emotional conditions in participants. Participants were required to learn Chipanese sentences in a training session through practice and then a grammaticality judgment task was administered to measure learning outcomes. We found that participants in positive emotional states performed less accurately and efficiently than those in the control group.

,"There is mounting evidence that prosody facilitates grouping the speech stream into syntactically-relevant units (e.g., Hawthorne & Gerken, 2014; Soderstrom, Kemler Nelson, & Jusczyk, 2005). We ask whether prosody's role in syntax acquisition relates to its general acoustic salience or to the learner's acquired knowledge of correlations between prosody and syntax in her native language. English- and Japanese-acquiring 19-month-olds listened to sentences from an artificial grammar with non-native prosody (Japanese or English, respectively), then were tested on their ability to recognize prosodically-marked constituents when the constituents had moved to a new position in the sentence. Both groups were able to use non-native prosody to parse speech into cohesive, reorderable, syntactic constituent-like units. Comparison with Hawthorne & Gerken (2014), in which English-acquiring infants were tested on sentences with English prosody, suggests that 19-month-olds are equally adept at using native and non-native prosody for at least some types of learning tasks and, therefore, that prosody is useful in early syntactic segmentation because of its acoustic salience.",['Learn Japanese - Language & Grammar Learning'],"[{'lastname': 'Hawthorne', 'firstname': 'Kara', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'University of Arizona, Department of Linguistics 1100 E University Blvd, Tucson, AZ 85721; University of Alberta, Department of Linguistics 2-40 Assiniboia Hall, Edmonton, AB, Canada T6G 2E7; khawthor@ualberta.ca.'}, {'lastname': 'Mazuka', 'firstname': 'Reiko', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Information Science Building 2-1 Hirosawa Wako City, Saitama 351-0199, Japan; Department of Psychology and Neuroscience Box 90086, 417 Chapel Drive, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708-0086 mazuka@brain.riken.jp.'}, {'lastname': 'Gerken', 'firstname': 'LouAnn', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'University of Arizona, Department of Psychology 1503 E University Blvd, Tucson, AZ 85721; gerken@email.arizona.edu.'}]",,,10.1016/j.jml.2015.03.005,Journal of memory and language,"['English', 'Japanese', 'constituents', 'language acquisition', 'prosodic bootstrapping', 'prosody', 'syntax acquisition']",,2015-04-15,25870497,,The acoustic salience of prosody trumps infants' acquired knowledge of language-specific prosodic patterns.,10
,"One universal feature of human languages is the division between grammatical functors and content words. From a learnability point of view, functors might provide entry points or anchors into the syntactic structure of utterances due to their high frequency. Despite its potentially universal scope, this hypothesis has not yet been tested on typologically different languages and on populations of different ages. Here we report a corpus study and an artificial grammar learning experiment testing the anchoring hypothesis in Basque, Japanese, French, and Italian adults. We show that adults are sensitive to the distribution of functors in their native language and use them when learning new linguistic material. However, compared to infants' performance on a similar task, adults exhibit a slightly different behavior, matching the frequency distributions of their native language more closely than infants do.

,"Each language has a unique set of phonemic categories and phonotactic rules which determine permissible sound sequences in that language. Behavioral research demonstrates that one's native language shapes the perception of both sound categories and sound sequences in adults, and neuroimaging results further indicate that the processing of native phonemes and phonotactics involves a left-dominant perisylvian brain network. Recent work using a novel technique, functional Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS), has suggested that a left-dominant network becomes evident toward the end of the first year of life as infants process phonemic contrasts. The present research project attempted to assess whether the same pattern would be seen for native phonotactics. We measured brain responses in Japanese- and French-learning infants to two contrasts: Abuna vs. Abna (a phonotactic contrast that is native in French, but not in Japanese) and Abuna vs. Abuuna (a vowel length contrast that is native in Japanese, but not in French). Results did not show a significant response to either contrast in either group, unlike both previous behavioral research on phonotactic processing and NIRS work on phonemic processing. To understand these null results, we performed similar NIRS experiments with Japanese adult participants. These data suggest that the infant null results arise from an interaction of multiple factors, involving the suitability of the experimental paradigm for NIRS measurements and stimulus perceptibility.

,"Health games provide opportunities for the treatment and prevention of childhood obesity. We developed a motion-controlled serious game for children that addresses 3 core topics of nutrition, physical activity, and stress coping. It is the first serious game that extensively targets the dietary energy density principle (DED-P) in relation to nutrition. The game is intended to provide an additional educational component for the prevention and treatment of obesity in children.
The Kids Obesity Prevention study aimed to evaluate the newly developed game and to evaluate how well children are able to understand and apply the DED-P.
This cluster randomized controlled trial collected data from 82 primary school children aged 9 to 12 years and their parents at baseline (T0), at 2 weeks after study commencement (T1), and at the 4-week follow-up (T2). The dropout rate was 3.6%. The intervention group (IG) played the game within 2 weeks (2 sessions with different game modules). One part of the game involves selection of food with the lower energy density when presented with a pair of foods. This allows assessment of whether the children have understood the DED-P and whether they can apply it to unknown foods under time pressure. The control group (CG) received a brochure about the food pyramid concept and physical activity. The primary outcome was the gain in knowledge (nutrition and stress coping) and measured with a pretested questionnaire. The secondary outcomes were the maintenance of knowledge, application of the DED-P, feelings during game play, game acceptance, and behavioral measures (physical activity, media consumption, and dietary intake).
The knowledge score ranging from 0 to 100 increased from T0 (IG: 53 [SD 10], CG: 50 [SD 11]) to T1 (IG: 69 [SD 11], CG: 52 [SD 12]) in IG versus CG (P<.001). At T2, the knowledge score of IG remained at the same level as that of T1. Game data showed that after DED-P education, the classification under time pressure of unknown versus known food pairs according to their DED category was similar (hit rate around 70%).

,"To examine the effect of the Virtual Sprouts intervention, an interactive multiplatform mobile gardening game, on dietary intake and psychosocial determinants of dietary behavior in minority youth.
In this quasi-experimental pilot intervention, 180 third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade students in Los Angeles Unified School District participated in a 3-week program that included three Virtual Sprouts gaming sessions, three in-school lessons, and three in-home activities, using a nutrition- and gardening-focused curriculum. Pre- and postintervention questionnaires were used to assess psychosocial determinants of dietary behavior, including knowledge about and self-efficacy to eat fruits and vegetables (FV). Data were collected on FV, whole grains, fiber, total sugar, added sugar, and energy from sugary beverages through the Block Kids Food Screener (""last week"" version) for Ages 2-17. Repeated measures analysis of covariance models was used for continuous outcomes, controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, school, and free school lunch.
After the intervention, the intervention group (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ116) compared with the control group (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ64) had a significantly improved self-efficacy to eat FV score (+1.6% vs. -10.3%, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.01), and an improved self-efficacy to cook FV score (+2.9% vs. -5.0%, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.05).

,"Children in households of lower socioeconomic status (SES) are more likely to be overweight/obese. We aimed to determine if home physical activity (PA) environments differed by SES and to explore home environment mediators of the relation of family SES to children's PA and sedentary behavior.
Participants were 715 children aged 6 to 11 from the Neighborhood Impact on Kids (NIK) Study. Household SES was examined using highest educational attainment and income. Home environment was measured by parent report on a survey. Outcomes were child's accelerometer-measured PA and parent-reported screen time. Mediation analyses were conducted for home environment factors that varied by SES.
Children from lower income households had greater media access in their bedrooms (TV 52% vs. 14%, DVD player 39% vs. 14%, video games 21% vs. 9%) but lower access to portable play equipment (bikes 85% vs. 98%, jump ropes 69% vs. 83%) compared to higher income children. Lower SES families had more restrictive rules about PA (2.5 vs. 2.0). Across SES, children watched TV/DVDs with parents/siblings more often than they engaged in PA with them. Parents of lower SES watched TV/DVDs with their children more often (3.1 vs. 2.5‚Äâdays/week). Neither total daily and home-based MVPA nor sedentary time differed by SES. Children's daily screen time varied from 1.7 hours/day in high SES to 2.4 in low SES families.

,"The situation of homeless children in Honiara, Solomon Islands had attracted the attention of Sister Doreen of the Angelican Sisters of the Church.  One discovery was that these young people had little knowledge of sexuality but were often sexually active. This article discusses the workshop developed by the Angelican Sisters of the Church that addresses the needs of the youth, particularly on the topics of adolescent sexual and reproductive health and HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). About 34 young people attended the 4-day seminar, which aimed to empower the kids into making the right decision and changing their behavior.  Among the activities during the program were the use of games, information and practical sessions, which included a condom demonstration in the form of a bingo game.  The workshop was a success, with kids started teaching their peers and parents and more requests for such workshops indicated that young people in Honoria are hungry for information on sex, sexuality, HIV/AIDS and STDs.",['Educational Games 4 Kids'],"[{'lastname': 'Gatu', 'firstname': 'R', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,Pacific AIDS alert bulletin,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Adolescents', 'Age Factors', 'Demographic Factors', 'Developing Countries', 'Diseases', 'Education', 'Educational Activities', 'Geographic Factors', 'Hiv Infections', 'Homeless Persons', 'Infections', 'Melanesia', 'Oceania', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Reproductive Tract Infections', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Sex Education', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Solomon Islands', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Summary Report', 'Viral Diseases', 'Workshops', 'Youth']",,2002-09-26,12295868,,Solomon Islands: reaching street children in Honiara.,16
,"In Brazil, more than 35,000 people have been diagnosed as having AIDS and 425,000 of the country's 150 million population are HIV seropositive.   HIV infections continue to take place through infections in the blood supply and ongoing risky behavior associated with sexual relations and IV drug use.  A marked lack of knowledge, prejudices and public myths persist about AIDS and despite the continued tide of HIV infection, Brazilians have been reluctant to shed the notion that AIDS is the problem of only discrete risk groups such as homosexuals and drug addicts.  Few have changed their sexual behavior or use condoms regularly.  Heterosexuals, however, especially women, are the fastest growing group of people with AIDS; 1 of every 6 Brazilians infected with HIV are women.  In response, the health ministry has mounted an aggressive STD program which operates regionally in almost all 27 Brazilian states.  Many nonprofit organizations have also risen to the challenge of AIDS and HIV infection, and reach out to various target audiences.  BEMFAM, for example the major nonprofit family planning agency in Brazil, has become a leader in AIDS prevention.  For the first time since its creation in 1965, the group distributed more condoms than oral contraceptive packages in 1992; 15.6 million and 2.9 million, respectively.  SOS Crianca is another organization fighting against HIV and AIDS in Brazil.  It has sent psychologists and social workers to plazas, alleys, and subway stations where street youths congregate to distribute condoms, counsel male and female prostitutes, educate them about their rights as minors, provide educational games to increase consciousness about health, and work to improve self-esteem.",['Educational Games 4 Kids'],"[{'lastname': 'Margolis', 'firstname': 'M', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,"Network (Research Triangle Park, N.C.)","['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome--prevention and control', 'Adolescents', 'Age Factors', 'Americas', 'Barrier Methods', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Brazil', 'Condom', 'Contraception', 'Contraceptive Methods', 'Contraceptive Usage', 'Demographic Factors', 'Developing Countries', 'Diseases', 'Education', 'Family Planning', 'Family Planning Programs', 'Health Education', 'Hiv Infections--prevention and control', 'Latin America', 'Organizations', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Premarital Sex Behavior', 'Prostitutes--men', 'Prostitutes--women', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sex Education', 'South America', 'Viral Diseases', 'Youth']",,1993-05-01,12344874,,Helping street kids cope with AIDS.,16

,"Salt intake is very high in China, with ‚âà80% being added by the consumers. It is difficult to reduce salt in such settings. Our previous study (School-based Education programme to reduce Salt(School-EduSalt)) demonstrated that educating schoolchildren, who then instructed their families to reduce the amount of salt used at home, is effective in lowering salt intake in both children and adults. Our team also developed an app called 'KnowSalt', which could help individuals to estimate their salt intake and the major sources of salt in the diet. Building on School-EduSalt and KnowSalt, we propose to develop a new app (AppSalt) focusing on salt reduction through education, target setting, monitoring, evaluation, decision support and management to achieve a progressive lower salt intake for long term. To evaluate the effectiveness of the AppSalt programme, we will carry out a cluster randomised controlled trial.
We will recruit 54 primary schools from urban and rural areas of three provinces in China. A total of 594 children aged 8-9 years and 1188 adult family members will be randomly selected for evaluation. After baseline assessment, schools will be randomly allocated to either the intervention or control group. Children in the intervention group will be taught, with support of AppSalt, about salt reduction and assigned homework to get the whole family involved in the activities to reduce salt consumption. The duration of the intervention is two school terms (ie, 1‚Äâyear). The primary outcome is the difference between the intervention and control group in the change of salt intake as measured by 24-hour urinary sodium.
The study has been approved by Queen Mary Research Ethics Committee and Peking University Health Science Centre IRB. Results will be disseminated through presentations, publications and social media.

,"Recently, Lowry et¬†al. addressed the ability of RADseq approaches to detect loci under selection in genome scans. While the authors raise important considerations, such as accounting for the extent of linkage disequilibrium in a study system, we strongly disagree with their overall view of the ability of RADseq to inform our understanding of the genetic basis of adaptation. The family of RADseq protocols has radically improved the field of population genomics, expanding by several orders of magnitude the number of markers available while substantially reducing the cost per marker. Researchers whose goal is to identify regions of the genome under selection must consider the LD of the experimental system; however, there is no magical LD cutoff below which researchers should refuse to use RADseq. Lowry et¬†al. further made two major arguments: a theoretical argument that modeled the likelihood of detecting selective sweeps with RAD markers, and gross summaries based on an anecdotal collection of RAD studies. Unfortunately, their simulations were off by two orders of magnitude in the worst case, while their anecdotes merely showed that it is possible to get widely divergent densities of RAD tags for any particular experiment, either by design or due to experimental efficacy. We strongly argue that RADseq remains a powerful and efficient approach that provides sufficient marker density for studying selection in many natural populations. Given limited resources, we argue that researchers should consider a wide range of trade-offs among genomic techniques, in light of their study question and the power of different techniques to answer it.","['Homework Help App | Scan Question, Get Answer']","[{'lastname': 'Catchen', 'firstname': 'Julian M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Biology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, 61801, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hohenlohe', 'firstname': 'Paul A', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biological Sciences, Institute for Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Studies, University of Idaho, 875 Perimeter Drive, Moscow, ID, 83844, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Bernatchez', 'firstname': 'Louis', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Institut de Biologie Int√©grative et des Syst√®mes (IBIS), Universit√© Laval, Qu√©bec, QC, G1V 0A6, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Funk', 'firstname': 'W Chris', 'initials': 'WC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biology, Graduate Degree Program in Ecology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, 80523, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Andrews', 'firstname': 'Kimberly R', 'initials': 'KR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Fish and Wildlife Sciences, University of Idaho, 875 Perimeter Drive MS 1136, Moscow, ID, 83844, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Allendorf', 'firstname': 'Fred W', 'initials': 'FW', 'affiliation': 'Division of Biological Sciences, University of Montana, Missoula, MT, 59812, USA.'}]",,¬© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.,10.1111/1755-0998.12669,Molecular ecology resources,"['RADseq', 'genome scan', 'linkage disequilibrium', 'selection']",,2017-03-21,28319339,,Unbroken: RADseq remains a powerful tool for understanding the genetics of adaptation in natural populations.,16
,"Is there any benefit to including the routine examination by ultrasound of the bladder, ureters and kidneys of women with endometriosis?
The benefit of examination of the complete urinary tract of women with suspected endometriosis is that ureteric endometriosis, with or without hydronephrosis, can be detected which facilitates early intervention to prevent nephropathy.
Women with endometriosis can get ureteric obstruction but there is no clear consensus on the correct diagnostic technique. Ultrasound is accurate at detecting women with bladder endometriosis but ureteric involvement has not been assessed previously.
This was a prospective observational study, conducted at a teaching hospital over a period of 14 months. A total of 848 women presenting with chronic pelvic pain were included into the study.
All women with chronic pelvic pain underwent a detailed transvaginal and transabdominal pelvic ultrasound examination to investigate possible causes of their symptoms. This included a systematic assessment of the urinary bladder, pelvic sections of the ureters and kidneys. The ultrasound findings were compared with findings at surgery and the results of targeted urological imaging and interventions.
A total of 848 women presenting with chronic pelvic pain were included into the study. 28/848 women (3.3% 95% CI 2.1-4.5) had evidence of urinary tract abnormalities on initial ultrasound scan. Among these 17/848 (2.0% 95% CI 1.06-2.94) had evidence of urinary tract endometriosis, whilst 11/848 (1.3% 95% CI 0.54-2.06) women had other urinary tract abnormalities. Among women with urinary tract endometriosis 11/17 (65%) had evidence of ureteric involvement, 3/17 (18%) had both ureteric and bladder disease and 3/17 (18%) had bladder disease only. 12/17 (59%) women with urinary tract endometriosis also had evidence of hydronephrosis.

The routine examination of the complete urinary tract including the distal ureters is a novel technique that should be evaluated in different populations.
Ultrasound is an accurate test to diagnose urinary tract involvement in women with suspected pelvic endometriosis and examination of the complete urinary tract should become an integral part of ultrasound assessment of women with suspected endometriosis.","['Homework Help App | Scan Question, Get Answer']","[{'lastname': 'Pateman', 'firstname': 'K', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gynaecology, University College Hospital, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Holland', 'firstname': 'T K', 'initials': 'TK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gynaecology, University College Hospital, London, UK tomkholland@gmail.com.'}, {'lastname': 'Knez', 'firstname': 'J', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gynaecology, University College Hospital, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Derdelis', 'firstname': 'G', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gynaecology, University College Hospital, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Cutner', 'firstname': 'A', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gynaecology, University College Hospital, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Saridogan', 'firstname': 'E', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gynaecology, University College Hospital, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Jurkovic', 'firstname': 'D', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gynaecology, University College Hospital, London, UK.'}]",,"¬© The Author 2015.

,"Learning disabilities or learning disorders are umbrella terms used for wide variety of learning problems like Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, Dysgraphia, and Dyspraxia. These disabilities are due to the neurological disorders which affects brain functions. Early diagnosis of these disabilities in kids from age 3 to 6 will help to start early medical treatments and get them back to the normal condition.
we developed a software-based Learning Disability Evaluation Kit called YALU with computer Game Modules for kids targeting their learning disabilities. These Computer game-based modules of the YALU consist of different tasks for the different age levels to identify the symptoms of the disabilities mentioned above. The children's interaction results to each task of the game modules with the answers of the questioner about the children given by the parents will be evaluated with the threshold values given by a panel of consultant psychologist and paediatrician of the normal kids to identify the learning disabilities in kids aged 3-6‚Äâyears. The result will be given to the respective parties and uploaded to the Website under the child's name.
YALU has been tested using 50 students in age 3-5 in three preschools. The teachers have identified Fourteen students with some learning disability symptoms.

,"Many mental health problems emerge in late childhood and contribute significantly to the global burden of disease. Adverse outcomes can extend into adulthood if left untreated. This impact is exacerbated in low- and middle-income countries where significant treatment gaps persist. Improving mental health literacy may offer an effective strategy for early intervention but remains underexplored in these contexts.
An intervention was co-developed with children and young people (CYP) by undertaking a needs analysis combined with stakeholder consensus activities. A systematic review of mental health literacy interventions in South-East Asia was undertaken in addition to semi-structured interviews with 43 children and young people (19 with and 24 without experience of anxiety and depression), 19 parents of children with experience of mental health problems and 25 education and health professionals. A focus group was also held with 8 key stakeholders immersed¬†nationally in policy and practice. Interview schedules explored participants' experiences of mental health, unmet needs and priorities for intervention. Data were synthesised and presented at a 3-day co-production workshop. Attendees included 13 CYP, 6 parents/guardians, 2 teachers, 8 health professionals, 2 academics and 3 game designers. Consensus exercises were utilised to identify the preferred format, content and delivery of the¬†intervention. A smaller group of patient and public involvement contributors worked with designers to further iterate the intervention.
An immersive storyline digital application was co-developed for young people aged 11-15 with the primary aim of improving mental health literacy and self-management. The intervention comprises two chapters; one depression focussed, and the other anxiety focussed. The storyline format is interspersed with interactive games and exercises to promote engagement and encourage self-management. CYP also take part in group sessions delivered by trained facilitators before and after intervention use to discuss outcomes of and issues raised during the game.

,"Handheld devices can automatically give an estimate of refraction. The established method for refraction comparison using spherical equivalent (M) and J0, J45 vector transformations by Bland-Altman analysis is too complex for non-eye doctors involved with vision screening and remote vision clinics. Therefore, a simpler comparison technique was developed.
Based on the spectacle limit to resolve grade A 1 logMAR, B 3 logMAR and C 6 logMAR blur, J0, J45, and M are combined into the Alaska Blind Child Discovery (ABCD) composite ellipsoid GRADE system. Pediatric eye patients had confirmatory examination after dry refraction with three portable autorefractors: Plusoptix, 2WIN and Retinomax. The refractions were then compared using both Bland-Altman and ABCD composite. Performance to detect AAPOS amblyopia risk factors was also assessed.
A total of 202 children, mean age seven years, 28% high spectacle need and 43% AAPOS 2013 amblyopia risk factors showed high correlation with cycloplegic refraction (intraclass correlation 0.49 to 0.90) for sphere, J0 and J45 spectacle components. Plusoptix had more (10%) inconclusives due to patients out-of-range. The Retinomax was unable to screen some younger children and was less reliable for sphere but gave more precise astigmatism estimates. The proportion of autorefractions expected to give GRADE A/B high-need patients acuity improvement to 20/40 would be 41% for Plusoptix, 39% for 2WIN and 65% for Retinomax. Sensitivity/specificity for amblyopia risk factor detection was 80%/83% for Plusoptix, 72%/88% for 2WIN and 84%/73% for Retinomax.

,"Procedural pain and anxiety in children can be poorly controlled, leading to significant short- and long-term sequelae, such as longer procedure times or future healthcare avoidance. Caregiver anxiety can exacerbate these effects. We aimed to evaluate the effect of interactive video game interventions on children's procedural pain and anxiety, including the effect of different types of video games on those outcomes.
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of interactive video games compared with standard care in children (0-18 yr) undergoing painful procedures. We searched the databases MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO. We conducted random-effects meta-analysis using 'R' of children's procedural pain and anxiety and caregivers' anxiety.
Of 2185 studies screened, 36 were eligible (n=3406 patients). Studies commonly involved venous access (33%) or day surgery (31%). Thirty-four studies were eligible for meta-analyses. Interactive video games appear to reduce children's procedural pain (standardised mean difference [SMD]=-0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.67 to -0.20), anxiety (SMD=0.61; 95% CI: -0.88 to -0.34), and caregivers' procedural anxiety (SMD=-0.31; 95% CI: -0.58 to -0.04). We observed no difference between preparatory and distracting games, or between virtual reality and non-virtual reality games. We also observed no difference between interactive video games compared with standard care for most medical outcomes (e.g. procedure length), except a reduced need for restraint. Studies reported minimal adverse effects and typically had high intervention acceptability and satisfaction.

,"The last decade has seen improved outcomes for children requiring extracorporeal life support as well as for children undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation. Thus, given the historically poor survival of hematopoietic cell transplantation patients using extracorporeal life support, the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigators' hematopoietic cell transplantation and cancer immunotherapy subgroup aimed to characterize the utility of extracorporeal life support in facilitating recovery from critical cardiorespiratory illnesses in pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation patients.
All available published data were identified using a set of PubMed search terms for pediatric extracorporeal life support and hematopoietic cell transplantation.
All articles that provided original reports of pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation patients who underwent extracorporeal life support were included. Sixty-four manuscripts met search criteria. Twenty-four were included as primary reports of pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation patients who underwent extracorporeal life support (11 were single case reports, four single institution case series, two multi-institution case series, and seven registry reports from Extracorporeal Life Support Organization, Pediatric Heath Information System, and Virtual Pediatric Systems).
All 24 articles were reviewed by first and last authors and a spread sheet was constructed including sample size, potential biases, and conclusions.
Discussions regarding incorporation of available evidence into our clinical practice were held at biannual meetings, as well as through email and virtual meetings. An expert consensus was determined through these discussions and confirmed through a modified Delphi process.
Extracorporeal life support in hematopoietic cell transplantation patients is being used with increasing frequency and potentially improving survival. The Pediatric Acute Lung Injury and Sepsis Investigators hematopoietic cell transplantation-cancer immunotherapy subgroup has developed a framework to guide physicians in decision-making surrounding extracorporeal life support candidacy in pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation patients. In addition to standard extracorporeal life support considerations, candidacy in the hematopoietic cell transplantation population should consider the following six factors in order of consensus agreement: 1) patient comorbidities; 2) underlying disease necessitating hematopoietic cell transplantation; 3) hematopoietic cell transplantation toxicities, 4) family and patient desires for goals of care; 5) hematopoietic cell transplantation preparatory regimen; and 6) graft characteristics. Although risk assessment may be individualized, data are currently insufficient to clearly delineate ideal candidacy. Therefore, we urge the onco-critical care community to collaborate and capture data to provide better evidence to guide physicians' decision-making in the future.",['Doctor Kids 2'],"[{'lastname': 'Zinter', 'firstname': 'Matt S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.

,"Seasonal influenza vaccination has been recommended for pregnant women in Germany since 2010. The aim of this study was to examine prevalence and determinants of receipt of provider recommendation for influenza vaccination as well as influenza vaccination uptake during pregnancy.
We analysed data from the ""KUNO Kids Health Study"", a prospective birth cohort. During the study period (5th July 2015 to 27th June 2018) data were collected from participating mothers by interview and questionnaire. According to Andersen's behavioural model of health services use potential influencing factors describing the circumstances and characteristics of the mothers and their pregnancies which are potentially affecting whether women receive a recommendation for a vaccination or whether they utilize influenza vaccination were classified into three domains: 'predisposing characteristics', 'enabling resources' and 'need'. Using multivariable logistic regression models odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated.
As a combined result across three flu seasons, 368 of 1814 (20.3%) women received an influenza vaccination recommendation during pregnancy. Having had a high-risk pregnancy increased the odds of receiving a vaccination recommendation (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.3; 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.0-1.6; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.045). In contrast, pregnancy onset in summer (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.7; 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.5-1.0; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.027), autumn (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.4; 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.3-0.5; p‚Äâ<‚Äâ=0.001) or winter (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.5; 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.3-0.6; p‚Äâ<‚Äâ=0.001) (compared to spring) as well as mother's birthplace outside Germany (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.6; 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.4-0.9; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.023) reduced the chance of getting a vaccination recommendation. Two hundred forty-two of one thousand eight hundred sixty-five (13%) women were vaccinated against influenza during pregnancy. Having received a vaccination recommendation was strongly associated with vaccination uptake (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ37.8; 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ25.5-55.9; p‚Äâ<‚Äâ=0.001). Higher health literacy status was also associated with a higher chance of vaccination uptake (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.7; 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.2-2.6; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.008), whereas pregnancy onset in autumn (compared to spring) reduced the chance (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.5; 95% CI‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.3-0.8; p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.008).
At 13% the uptake rate of influenza vaccination is low. Having received a recommendation to vaccinate was strongly associated with uptake but only one fifth of all mothers report such a recommendation. Raising awareness in physicians regarding vaccinating during pregnancy seems to be of essential importance to increase vaccine uptake and to prevent influenza-related complications in pregnant women.",['Doctor Kids 2'],"[{'lastname': 'Brixner', 'firstname': 'Alexandra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""University Children's Hospital Regensburg (KUNO-Clinics), at the Hospital St. Hedwig of the Order of St. John, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.""}, {'lastname': 'Brandstetter', 'firstname': 'Susanne', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""University Children's Hospital Regensburg (KUNO-Clinics), at the Hospital St. Hedwig of the Order of St. John, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.\nMember of the Research and Development Campus Regensburg (WECARE) at the Hospital St. Hedwig of the Order of St. John, Regensburg, Germany.""}, {'lastname': 'B√∂hmer', 'firstname': 'Merle M', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': 'Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority, Oberschleissheim, Germany.\nInstitute of Social Medicine and Health Systems Research, Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Seelbach-G√∂bel', 'firstname': 'Birgit', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynaecology St. Hedwig, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Melter', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""University Children's Hospital Regensburg (KUNO-Clinics), at the Hospital St. Hedwig of the Order of St. John, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.\nMember of the Research and Development Campus Regensburg (WECARE) at the Hospital St. Hedwig of the Order of St. John, Regensburg, Germany.""}, {'lastname': 'Kabesch', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""University Children's Hospital Regensburg (KUNO-Clinics), at the Hospital St. Hedwig of the Order of St. John, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.\nMember of the Research and Development Campus Regensburg (WECARE) at the Hospital St. Hedwig of the Order of St. John, Regensburg, Germany.""}, {'lastname': 'Apfelbacher', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Member of the Research and Development Campus Regensburg (WECARE) at the Hospital St. Hedwig of the Order of St. John, Regensburg, Germany. christian.apfelbacher@med.ovgu.de.\nInstitute of Social Medicine and Health Systems Research, Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg, Magdeburg, Germany. christian.apfelbacher@med.ovgu.de.'}, {'lastname': None, 'firstname': None, 'initials': None, 'affiliation': None}]",,¬© 2021.

,"The purpose of this study was to quantify the hospitalization charges of the 2 general surgical approaches in the treatment of craniosynostosis and determine if there was a significant difference between the 2. Several studies compared them side-by-side according to specific variables, such as success rates, postoperative complications, blood loss, and length of stay, but were limited by small sample sizes.
This is a retrospective cohort study that was conducted using the Kids' Inpatient Database (KID). All patients diagnosed with craniosynostosis (Q75.0) were identified. The procedures were grouped according to the approach taken, whether it was a traditional, open approach, or a closed, minimally invasive approach. The primary predictor variable was the surgical approach (open vs closed). The outcome variables were the hospital charges (US dollars) and length of stay (days). Statistical analyses were based on the univariate and multivariate linear regression models, and P value less than .05 marked the significance level.
Among a sample of 2,585 cases, an open approach was employed in 2,353 cases and a closed approach in 232 cases. Race, payer information, hospital region, admission status (elective vs not elective), patient location, and surgical approach (open vs closed) were all significant predictors (P < .15) of increased hospitalization charges. Relative to white patients, being in the 'other' racial class added $10,987 in hospital charges (P < .05). Relative to the Northeast, being a patient in the West added $33,459 in hospital charges (P < .01). Not being admitted electively added $72,572 (P < .01) relative to elective admissions. Finally, open repair added $59,539 (P < .01) in charges relative to closed repair.
The traditional open approach added nearly $60,000 to the cost of the procedure when compared with the closed, endoscopic approach. The scope and invasiveness of the open approach demand greater surgical services, hospital services, supplies, and equipment, ultimately contributing to this increased cost.",['Doctor Kids 2'],"[{'lastname': 'Stanbouly', 'firstname': 'Dani', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Dental Student, Columbia University College of Dental Medicine, New York, NY.

,"To compare type 2 polysomnography (T2PSG) to the gold standard type 1 in-laboratory polysomnography (T1PSG) for diagnosing obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children; validate home T2PSG in children with suspected OSA.
81 participants (ages 6-18) with suspected OSA had simultaneous T1PSG and T2PSG in the sleep laboratory, 47 participants (ages 5-16) had T1PSG in the sleep laboratory and T2PSG performed at home. Sleep scientists staged and scored PSG data, pediatric sleep physicians assigned a diagnosis of normal or OSA. Participant demographics, PSG variables and diagnoses were compared using Chi-Squared and Fischer's exact tests for nominal variables, t-test for continuous variables and Cohen's kappa to assess concordance.
Acceptable recordings were obtained for every home T2PSG. When T1PSG and T2PSG were simultaneous, correlation between the number of arousals, respiratory disturbance index and sleep stages was excellent. T2PSG at home demonstrated less stage 2 sleep, more rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and higher sleep efficiency. Comparison of home T2PSG to T1PSG for diagnosing OSA showed a false positive rate of 6.6% and false negative rate of 3% for those performed at home.
T2PSG in the home is feasible with excellent concordance with T1PSG for the purposes of diagnosing OSA in children aged 5-18 years. Home T2PSG may be more representative of a 'normal' night for children and could benefit those suspected of having OSA by reducing waiting times for laboratory PSG, improving access to PSG and possibly reducing costs of investigating and treating OSA.",['Doctor Kids 2'],"[{'lastname': 'Withers', 'firstname': 'Adelaide', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Perth Children's Hospital, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.\nTelethon Kids Institute, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.\nWal-yan Respiratory Research Centre, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.\nCurtin University, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Maul', 'firstname': 'Jennifer', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Perth Children's Hospital, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Rosenheim', 'firstname': 'Ellen', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': ""Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.""}, {'lastname': ""O'Donnell"", 'firstname': 'Anne', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Perth Children's Hospital, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Wilson', 'firstname': 'Andrew', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Perth Children's Hospital, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.\nTelethon Kids Institute, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.\nCurtin University, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.\nDivision of Paediatrics and Child Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.""}, {'lastname': 'Stick', 'firstname': 'Prof Stephen', 'initials': 'PS', 'affiliation': ""Department of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Perth Children's Hospital, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.\nTelethon Kids Institute, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.\nWal-yan Respiratory Research Centre, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.\nDivision of Paediatrics and Child Health, Faculty of Medicine, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.\nUniversity of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.""}]",,¬© 2021 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.,10.5664/jcsm.9576,Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine,"['home sleep apnea testing', 'pediatric obstructive sleep apnea', 'polysomnography']",,2021-07-30,34323688,"Acceptable recordings were obtained for every home T2PSG.

,"Malnutrition has multiple causes, not just a lack of calories. We explored the successes and barriers of an innovative, comprehensive programme in Madagascar that educated mothers in particular about nutrition.
The outpatient programme in Antananarivo treats 2400 malnourished children from 6 to 59 months each year. The 35-day programme comprises health checks, cooking demonstrations, the distribution of enriched flour supplements and two food-related games that are called Nutricartes and are based on boards and picture cards. In 2014, we involved 74 of the children's mothers in a realistic evaluation process, which investigates the mechanisms that produce a particular outcome in a given context.
The mechanisms of success were the community-based aspects of the programme, the kindness and equality displayed by the nutritional assistants and improved household budgeting and hygiene.

,"This study aimed to examine the association between subjective symptoms and lifestyle habits among junior high school students by using a cross-sectional survey.
The survey was conducted during May-November 2012. The study subjects were 1229 adolescents (527 boys and 702 girls, age 12-13 years) from 10 junior high schools in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan. Data from 1182 students (500 boys and 682 girls; response rate 96.2%) were used for the analyses. School nurses measured students' body weights and heights. A self-administered questionnaire examining dietary intake (FFQW82), subjective symptoms (12 items), lifestyle habits (18 items), and diet- and health-related topics (9 items) was used. The 4 categories of each of the 12 subjective symptoms were classified into dichotomous variables (1=always or sometimes; 0=occasionally or never). The subjective symptom score was calculated as a total score by summing up the dichotomous variables for the 12 subjective symptoms. Associations were examined using a chi-square test, Student's t-test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, and a stepwise regression model. The structure of factors was examined by factor analysis (varimax rotation) and associations among the question items were examined by principal component analysis. A significance level of 5% (two-sided) was applied and SAS ver. 9.3 software was used for the analyses.
Students' body weights and heights were mostly at or near national averages. The ratio of energy intake at breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the 1-day total energy intake (kcal) was respectively 2:3:4, indicating decreased energy intake at breakfast. The percent energy (%E) from fat of the 1-day total energy intake was 29%E for boys and 30%E for girls. Using regression models, we found that the following lifestyle factors were significantly related to fewer subjective symptoms: ""balanced diet,"" and ""sleeping 6 hours or more per day"" were for boys and girls, ""regularly eating three meals a day,"" ""strong appetite,"" and ""having relaxation time"" for girls. However, the following factors were significantly related to more subjective symptoms: ""eating hurriedly,"" and ""2 hours or more of watching television or playing video games"" were for boys and girls, ""cooking meals or sweets"" for boys, ""eating snacks and nighttime meals,"" and ""eating dinner after 9 p.m.,"" and ""preparing bento (boxed lunches)"" for girls. Dietary intake was not significantly related to subjective symptoms.

,"Literacy plays an important role in the development of language in school-age children and adolescents. For example, by reading a variety of books, magazines, and newspapers, students gain exposure to complex vocabulary, and reading becomes a prime opportunity for learning new words. Despite the importance of reading for lexical development, little is known about the pleasure reading habits of today's youth. The first goal of this investigation was to examine the preferences of older children and young adolescents with respect to reading as a leisure-time activity and its relationship to other free-time options that are likely to compete for their attention. The second goal was to examine the amount of time that young people spend reading for pleasure each day and the types of materials they most enjoy reading. The third goal was to determine if preferences for free-time activities and reading materials would evince age- and gender-related differences during the period of development from late childhood through early adolescence (ages 11-15 years). The findings could serve as a reference point for understanding what is reasonable to expect of students during this age range.
The participants were 100 sixth graders (mean age = 11;7 [years; months]) and 100 ninth graders (mean age = 14;8) attending public schools in western Oregon. Each group contained an equal number of boys and girls, all of whom spoke English as their primary language and were considered to be typical achievers. All participants completed a survey concerning their preferred free-time activities and reading materials. They also reported the average amount of time they spent reading for pleasure each day.
The most popular free-time activities were listening to music/going to concerts, watching television or videos, playing sports, and playing computer or video games. Least preferred activities were cooking, running or walking, writing, and arts and crafts. Reading was moderately popular. The most popular reading materials were magazines, novels, and comics; least popular were plays, technical books, and newspapers. Interest in pleasure reading declined during this age range (11-15 years), and boys were more likely than girls to report that they spent no time reading for pleasure.
Given the importance of reading to lexical development in school-age children and adolescents, reading should be promoted as a leisure activity during these years. School-based speech-language pathologists (SLPs), in their role as language consultants, can benefit from understanding the pleasure-reading patterns of today's youth. It is especially important for SLPs to monitor these patterns in students who have language disorders, as it is common for these young people to experience deficits in reading and in lexical development. Fortunately, much can be done in school settings to encourage strong literacy habits in all students if SLPs work collaboratively with teachers, principals, psychologists, librarians, parents, and students. Suggestions are offered for ways to encourage young people to spend more time reading for pleasure.",['Cooking School: Games for Girls'],"[{'lastname': 'Nippold', 'firstname': 'Marilyn A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'College of Education, University of Oregon, Eugene, USA. nippold@uoregon.edu'}, {'lastname': 'Duthie', 'firstname': 'Jill K', 'initials': 'JK', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Larsen', 'firstname': 'Jennifer', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': None}]",,,10.1044/0161-1461(2005/009),"Language, speech, and hearing services in schools",[],"The participants were 100 sixth graders (mean age = 11;7 [years; months]) and 100 ninth graders (mean age = 14;8) attending public schools in western Oregon.

,"It has often been said that ignorance is the most cause of malnutrition. However, in the Pacific Islands rapid modernization has confronted the people with the realization that their traditional way of life is no longer applicable and socially acceptable: this has led to the adoption of practices that are not fully understood or carried out properly (as is the case in bottle feeding). The nutrition education programme described in the paper attempts to halp individuals and communities become aware of the changes taking place and their consequences, and to provide them with the knowledge they need to seek solutions by themselves. To consolidate nutrition education in the various islands, training is undertaken by the Community Education Training Centre and in the territories through in-service courses. The level of training is highly practical and stresses skills and information useful for village people. Emphasis is on methods of motivating the community and techniques in nutrition education; the use of growth charts, cooking demonstrations, vegetable gardens and the proper use of audio-visual aids. One aim is to promote the consumption of coconut milk instead of soft drinks, while a major focus is the encouragement of breast feeding. Recipes are traditional ones modified for higher nutritive value, such as the addition of vegetables, perhaps taro leaves, or banana flower to a typical fish soup. In school, learning units have also been developed to promote appreciation of local food. Apart from the conventional educational techniques and materials, new aids are being utilised, especially games: nutrition bingo, gin rummy, menu planning games, the coconut climber's game, nutrition puzzles, etc. It is the author's experience that, to be effective, nutrition education programmes have to be an integral part of a national strategy aimed at combatting malnutrition. Isolated efforts may be better than none, but results remain marginal, if only because there is such a disparity between the problem and the response to it in the form of nutrition schemes.
Food is one of the major expenses for most Pacific Islanders.  As buying patterns are increasingly influenced by factors such as the prestige of imported and convenience foods, nutritional problems become more widespread.  The South Pacific Commission is undertaking training at 2 levels to consolidate nutrition education in the various islands.  The Community Education Training Center in Suva provides home economics training to women working at the community level, and in addition a Mobile Home EConomics Training Unit staffed by a nutritionist, home economist, and agricultural extension officer provides training in the different island groups.  The recently formed women's federations have incorporated consumber education into their work programs.  Nutrition education programs in a number of islands combine conventional techniques and materials with less orthodox instructional methods to change attitudes and practices.  A campaign to substitute consumption of coconut milk for soft drinks includes parodies of soft drink advertisements, displays of posters promoting coconut milk in stores, and provision of coconut milk instead of other drinks at government meetings.  Encouragement of breast feeding is a major focus of nutrition education programs, and the message is spread in radio programs in local languages, pictorial infant feeding manuals given to new mothers, in women's committees and in schools.  Cooking demonstrations with the women's committees in the villages, a training program for mothers of malnourished children in hospitals, and development of games such as nutrition bingo are among other activities intended to increase knowledge of the nutritional value of foods.",['Cooking School: Games for Girls'],"[{'lastname': 'Jabre', 'firstname': 'B', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': None}]",,,,International journal of health education,"['Breast Feeding', 'Delivery Of Health Care', 'Education', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational Technics', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Infant Nutrition', 'Nutrition', 'Nutrition Programs', 'Palau', 'Primary Health Care', 'Summary Report']",,1981-01-01,7257611,,Innovative approaches in nutrition education in the Pacific region.,7

,"The variability in diagnostic imaging caseload, increasing class sizes, high hospital workloads, and the progressive departure of veterinary radiologists from academia can lead to inconsistent and reduced teaching opportunities. This one group pretest, posttest study aimed to compare the learning outcomes of students enrolled in two veterinary radiology clerkship models. Our hypothesis was that the learning and satisfaction scores of students in a case-based veterinary radiology clerkship would be higher than those in a clinical veterinary radiology clerkship. During the spring and summer semesters of 2019, students were assigned to a clinical (CRC) or case-based (CBRC) radiology clerkship model, respectively. Prior to starting the clerkship and at the conclusion thereof, all students took identical radiographic interpretation quizzes. Four major areas of learning were assessed: knowledge base (KB), diagnostic test interpretation (DTI), problem prioritization and differential diagnosis (PPDDX), and critical thinking (CrT). A total of 41 of 48 (CRC) and 130 of 151 (CBRC) students enrolled in this study; 15 and 34, respectively, were off-shore students, while the remainder were in-house students. In-house students improved their scores with CRC and CBRC, but achieved better scores in the four areas with CBRC. Off-shore students only improved their scores with CBRC. In both groups, there was a negative effect of CRC on DTI. Course satisfaction score was 3.21 on CRC and 4.38 on CBRC (range 1-5).

,"This study aimed to determine the potential prophylactic efficacy of probiotic individually and/or in combination with anti-coccidial drug on the performance and immunity of broilers under an induced coccidial infection over a 28-day of experimental trial.
One hundred and eighty 1-day-old Cobb broiler chicks were randomly divided into five groups, included control group (CG), control positive group (CPG), probiotic-treated group (Prob), diclazuril-treated group (Dic), and probiotic¬†+¬†diclazuril-treated group (Prob¬†+¬†Dic). On day 21 of age, all birds, except group CG, were orally inoculated with 1¬†ml of tap water containing 25,000 Eimeria tenella sporulated oocysts.
Our results showed that the probiotic treatment did not influence pre-challenge body weight, feed intake and feed conversion ratio (FCR). During the post-challenge period, chickens in groups probiotic and diclazuril individually and in combination exhibited higher body weight and lower (better) FCR, reduced oocyst shedding (throughout the day four, five, six and seven post-infection), cecal lesions and mortality compared with control positive chickens. Moreover, Compared to CPG group, Prob¬†+¬†Dic group showed increased (p¬†<¬†0.05) serum levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) and decreased the concentrations of interferon gamma (IFN-Œ≥). On the other hand, individual treatment with probiotic exhibited highest serum levels of IL-10 and IgM, while diclazuril alone increased the blood concentrations of IL-10 and decreased the levels of IFN-Œ≥ compared to control positive group; however, there was no significant effect of Prob on IFN-Œ≥, Dic on IgM and all groups on interleukin-17.
In conclusion, supplementation of probiotic, with and/or without anti-coccidial drug, enhances immunity and inhibits the negative effects of Eimeria infection.

,"To explore the potential alternative of anti-coccidials, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of dietary Piper sarmentosum extract (PSE) on induced coccidia infection in chickens. A total of 96-day-old chickens were randomly distributed to 1 of 3 treatment groups, including (1) control negative untreated uninfected (CN), (2) control positive untreated infected (CP), and (3) Piper sarmentosum (P. sarmentosum) extract-treated infected group (PSE). Our results demonstrated that E. tenella challenged untreated group showed a reduction (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05) in post-infection (PI) body weight compared to control negative group. However, supplementation of P. sarmentosum extract had no significant effects on body weight and cecal lesions compared with control positive group. Infected chickens fed PSE diet decreased (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05) the bloody diarrhea scores and oocyst shedding (during the day 5 to 8 post-infection) than that of CP chickens. E. tenella-challenged chickens upregulated (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05) the mRNA expression of IL-8 and Bcl-2 compared to PSE chickens, while IFN-Œ≥ compared to CN chickens. On the other hand, treatment of P. sarmentosum extract tended to increase (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05) the transcription patterns of IL-4, IL-10, CLDN 1, SOD 1, and Bax with the comparison of control positive group; however, there were no significant effects on IL-8, ZO 1, and CAT expression between the PSE and CP groups.

,"This paper is a practical guide to neurophenomenology. Varela's neurophenomenological research program (NRP) aspires to bridge the gap between, and integrate, first-person (1P) and third-person (3P) approaches to understanding the mind. It does so by suggesting a methodological framework allowing these two irreducible phenomenal domains to relate and reciprocally support the investigation of one another. While highly appealing theoretically, neurophenomenology invites researchers to a challenging methodological endeavor. Based on our experience with empirical neurophenomenological implementation, we offer practical clarifications and insights learnt along the way. In the first part of the paper, we outline the theoretical principles of the NRP and briefly present the field of 1P research. We speak to the importance of phenomenological training and outline the utility of cooperating with meditators as skilled participants. We suggest that 1P accounts of subjective experience can be placed on a complexity continuum ranging between thick and thin phenomenology, highlighting the tension and trade-off inherent to the neurophenomenological attempt to naturalize phenomenology. We then outline a typology of bridges, which create mutual constraints between 1P and 3P approaches, and argue for the utility of alternating between the bridges depending on the available experimental resources, domain of interest and level of sought articulation. In the second part of the paper, we demonstrate how the theory can be put into practice by describing a decade of neurophenomenological studies investigating the sense of self with increasing focus on its embodied, and minimal, aspects. These aspects are accessed via the dissolution of the sense-of-boundaries, shedding new light on the multi-dimensionality and flexibility of embodied selfhood. We emphasize the evolving neurophenomenological dialogue, showing how consecutive studies, placed differently on the thin-to-thick 1P continuum, advance the research project by using the bridging principles appropriate for each stage.",['Learn Hebrew.

,"Selective mutism is an uncommon disorder in young children, in which they selectively don't speak in certain social situations, while being capable of speaking easily in other social situations. Many etiologies were proposed for selective mutism including psychodynamic, behavioral and familial etc. A developmental etiology that includes insights from all the above is gaining support. Accordingly, mild language impairment in a child with an anxiety trait may be at the root of developing selective mutism. The behavior will be reinforced by an avoidant pattern in the family. Early treatment and followup for children with selective mutism is important. The treatment includes non-pharmacological therapy (psychodynamic, behavioral and familial) and pharmacologic therapy--mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI).",['Learn Hebrew.

,"This study examined the distribution of two Hebrew nominal structures-N-N compounds and denominal adjectives-in spoken and written texts of two genres produced by 90 native-speaking participants in three age groups: eleven/twelve-year-olds (6th graders), sixteen/seventeen-year-olds (11th graders), and adults. The two constructions are later linguistic acquisitions, part of the profound lexical and syntactic changes that occur in language development during the school years. They are investigated in the context of learning how modality (speech vs. writing) and genre (biographical vs. expository texts) affect the production of continuous discourse. Participants were asked to speak and write about two topics, one biographical, describing the life of a public figure or of a friend; and another, expository, discussing one of ten topics such as the cinema, cats, or higher academic studies. N-N compounding was found to be the main device of complex subcategorization in Hebrew discourse, unrelated to genre. Denominal adjectives are a secondary subcategorizing device emerging only during the late teen years, a linguistic resource untapped until very late, more restricted to specific text types than N-N compounding, and characteristic of expository writing. Written texts were found to be denser than spoken texts lexically and syntactically as measured by number of novel N-N compounds and denominal adjectives per clause, and in older age groups this difference was found to be more pronounced. The paper contributes to our understanding of how the syntax/lexicon interface changes with age, modality and genre in the context of later language acquisition.",['Learn Hebrew.

,"The required adjustments precipitated by the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis have been challenging, but also represent a critical opportunity for the evolution and potential disruptive and constructive change of medical education. Given that the format of medical education is not fixed, but malleable and in fact must be adaptable to societal needs through ongoing reflexivity, we find ourselves in a potentially transformative learning phase for the field. An Association for Medical Education in Europe ASPIRE Academy group of 18 medical educators from seven countries was formed to consider this opportunity, and identified critical questions for collective reflection on current medical education practices and assumptions, with the attendant challenge to envision the future of medical education. This was achieved through online discussion as well as asynchronous collective reflections by group members. Four major themes and related conclusions arose from this conversation: Why we teach: the humanitarian mission of medicine should be reinforced; what we teach: disaster management, social accountability and embracing an environment of complexity and uncertainty should be the core; how we teach: open pathways to lean medical education and learning by developing learners embedded in a community context; and whom we teach: those willing to take professional responsibility. These collective reflections provide neither fully matured digests of the challenges of our field, nor comprehensive solutions; rather they are offered as a starting point for medical schools to consider as we seek to harness the learning opportunities stimulated by the pandemic.",['Learn English Conversation'],"[{'lastname': 'Han', 'firstname': 'Heeyoung', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, IL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Clithero-Eridon', 'firstname': 'Amy', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Costa', 'firstname': 'Manuel Jo√£o', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'School of Medicine, University, Braga, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Dennis', 'firstname': 'Caitriona A', 'initials': 'CA', 'affiliation': 'University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Dorsey', 'firstname': 'J Kevin', 'initials': 'JK', 'affiliation': 'Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, IL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ghias', 'firstname': 'Kulsoom', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan.'}, {'lastname': 'Hopkins', 'firstname': 'Alex', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, IL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jabeen', 'firstname': 'Kauser', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan.'}, {'lastname': 'Klamen', 'firstname': 'Debra', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, IL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Matos', 'firstname': 'Sophia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, IL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Mellinger', 'firstname': 'John D', 'initials': 'JD', 'affiliation': 'Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, IL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Peters', 'firstname': 'Harm', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Charit√©, Universit√§tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Pitama', 'firstname': 'Suzanne', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand.'}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'C Leslie', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': 'Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, IL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Susan F', 'initials': 'SF', 'affiliation': 'Imperial College School of Medicine, London, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Suh', 'firstname': 'Boyung', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, IL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Suh', 'firstname': 'Sookyung', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Springfield, IL, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zdravkoviƒá', 'firstname': 'Marko', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'University Medical Centre Maribor, Maribor.\nFaculty of Medicine, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia.'}]",,,10.3946/kjme.2021.207,Korean journal of medical education,"['COVID-19 pandemic', 'Distance education', 'Forecasting', 'Medical education', 'Social responsibility']",,2021-12-08,34875155,,On pandemics and pivots: a COVID-19 reflection on envisioning the future of medical education.,7
,"Engaging influential stakeholders in meaningful exchange is essential for pharmaceutical companies aiming to improve care. At a time where opportunities for face-to-face engagement are limited, the ability to interact,¬†learn¬†and generate actionable insights through digital channels such as Twitter, is of considerable value.
The aim of this study was to evaluate digital engagement among global diabetes mellitus researchers.
We identified every global tweet (20,614,515) and scientific publication (44,135) regarding diabetes mellitus from 1 August 2018 to 1 August 2020. Through author matching we combined datasets, resulting in a list of digitally active scientific authors. Generalised linear modelling identified factors predicting their digital engagement.
Globally, 2686 diabetes researchers used Twitter to discuss the management of diabetes mellitus, posting 110,346 diabetes-related tweets. As Twitter followers increased, so did tweet frequency (p¬†<¬†0.001), retweets (p¬†<¬†0.001) and replies (p¬†<¬†0.001) to their content. Publication count (overall/per month) and proportion of first/last authorships were unrelated to tweet frequency and the likelihood of being retweeted or replied to (p¬†>¬†0.05). Those with the most ¬†academic¬†co-authors were significantly less likely to tweet than those with smaller networks (<¬†50; p¬†=¬†0.001). Finally, those publishing most frequently on specific themes, including insulin (p¬†=¬†0.041) and paediatrics (p¬†<¬†0.001), were significantly more likely to tweet about these themes.
Academic expertise and seniority cannot be assumed as proxies for digital influence. Those aiming to promote science and obtain digital insights regarding condition management should consider looking beyond well-known 'key opinion leaders' to perhaps lesser known 'digital opinion leaders' with smaller academic networks, who are likely to specialise in the delivery of highly specific content to captive audiences.
Traditionally, research scientists and clinical experts in any field make their opinions and expertise known by writing academic journal papers. After successful peer review, they are accepted and made publicly available. However, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, more scientific information has been shared and discussed using digital platforms such as Twitter than ever before, setting the stage for their greater role in scientific discussions in the future. It is important that the pharmaceutical industry is aware of this shift as it may offer up new insights and opportunities. Using diabetes as a test case, we compared researchers‚Äô publishing activity with their Twitter activity over a 2-year period. We found that less established researchers who are less well-known in their fields, and with less publications to their name, are far more likely to be active in sharing valuable scientific content to large Twitter audiences. This makes them ‚Äòopinion leaders‚Äô even if they would not be thought of as such in a traditional, academic sense, suggesting that those who look only to high-ranking academic journals, and those who publish within them, may be missing an important and ever-increasing part of the conversation. This is the first ever study to compare digital and traditional publishing activities and highlights the potential of this approach to gain novel and valuable knowledge about specific topics.",['Learn English Conversation'],"[{'lastname': 'Leigh', 'firstname': 'Simon', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'VISFO, Mill Royd St., HD6 1EY, Brighouse, UK. simon@visfo.health.\nInstitute of Digital Healthcare, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK. simon@visfo.health.'}, {'lastname': 'Noble', 'firstname': 'Max E', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': 'VISFO, Mill Royd St., HD6 1EY, Brighouse, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Pearson', 'firstname': 'Frances E', 'initials': 'FE', 'affiliation': 'VISFO, Mill Royd St., HD6 1EY, Brighouse, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Iremonger', 'firstname': 'James', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'VISFO, Mill Royd St., HD6 1EY, Brighouse, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Williams', 'firstname': 'David T', 'initials': 'DT', 'affiliation': 'VISFO, Mill Royd St., HD6 1EY, Brighouse, UK.'}]","Academic expertise and seniority cannot be assumed as proxies for digital influence.

,"Digital conversations can offer unique information into the attitudes of Hispanics with depression outside of formal clinical settings and help generate useful information for medical treatment planning. Our study aimed to explore the big data from open-source digital conversations among Hispanics with regard to depression, specifically attitudes toward depression comparing Hispanics and non-Hispanics using machine learning technology.
Advanced machine-learning empowered methodology was used to mine and structure open-source digital conversations of self-identifying Hispanics and non-Hispanics who endorsed suffering from depression and engaged in conversation about their tone, topics, and attitude towards depression. The search was limited to 12¬†months originating from US internet protocol (IP) addresses. In this cross-sectional study, only unique posts were included in the analysis and were primarily analyzed for their tone, topic, and attitude towards depression between the two groups using descriptive statistical tools.
A total of 441,000 unique conversations about depression, including 43,000 (9.8%) for Hispanics, were posted. Source analysis revealed that 48% of conversations originated from topical sites compared to 16% on social media. Several critical differences were noted between Hispanics and non-Hispanics. In a higher percentage of Hispanics, their conversations portray ""negative tone"" due to depression (66% vs 39% non-Hispanics), show a resigned/hopeless attitude (44% vs. 30%) and were about 'living with' depression (44% vs. 25%). There were important differences in the author's determined sentiments behind the conversations among Hispanics and non-Hispanics.
In this first of its kind big data analysis of nearly a half-million digital conversations about depression using machine learning, we found that Hispanics engage in an online conversation about negative, resigned, and hopeless attitude towards depression more often than non-Hispanic.",['Learn English Conversation'],"[{'lastname': 'Castilla-Puentes', 'firstname': 'Ruby', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Center for Clinical and Translational Science and Training, University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.

,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, is a progressive disease beginning with mild memory loss, possibly leading to loss of the ability to carry on a conversation and respond to environments. It can seriously affect a person's ability to carry out daily activities. Therefore, early diagnosis of AD is conducive to better treatment and avoiding further deterioration of the disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become the main tool for humans to study brain tissues. It can clearly reflect the internal structure of a brain and plays an important role in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. MRI data is widely used for disease diagnosis. In this paper, based on MRI data, a method combining a 3D convolutional neural network and ensemble learning is proposed to improve the diagnosis accuracy. Then, a data denoising module is proposed to reduce boundary noise. The experimental results on ADNI dataset demonstrate that the model proposed in this paper improves the training speed of the neural network and achieves 95.2% accuracy in AD vs. NC (normal control) task and 77.8% accuracy in sMCI (stable mild cognitive impairment) vs. pMCI (progressive mild cognitive impairment) task in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.",['Learn English Conversation'],"[{'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Peng', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang 110819, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Shukuan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang 110819, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Qiao', 'firstname': 'Jianzhong', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang 110819, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Tu', 'firstname': 'Yue', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang 110819, China.'}]",,,10.3390/s21227634,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","['Alzheimer‚Äôs disease', 'convolutional neural network', 'data denoising', 'ensemble learning']",,2021-11-28,34833710,,Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease with Ensemble Learning Classifier and 3D Convolutional Neural Network.,7

,"Ending preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 will not be possible without evidence-based strategies addressing the health and care of low birthweight (LBW, <2.5‚Äâkg) infants. The majority of LBW infants are born in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and account for more than 60%-80% of newborn deaths. Feeding promotion tailored to meet the nutritional needs of LBW infants in LMICs may serve a crucial role in curbing newborn mortality rates and promoting growth. The Low Birthweight Infant Feeding Exploration (LIFE) study aims to establish foundational knowledge regarding optimal feeding options for LBW infants in low-resource settings throughout infancy.
LIFE is a formative, multisite, observational cohort study involving 12 study facilities in India, Malawi and Tanzania, and using a convergent parallel, mixed-methods design. We assess feeding patterns, growth indicators, morbidity, mortality, child development and health system inputs that facilitate or hinder care and survival of LBW infants.
This study was approved by 11 ethics committees in India, Malawi, Tanzania and the USA. The results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations targeting the global and local research, clinical, programme implementation and policy communities.

,"Respiratory Tract Infections (RTIs) and Gastro-Intestinal (GI) infections are the leading causes of child mortality and morbidity. This study investigates the associations between the individual, household and slum-level determinants of children's health and vulnerability to RTIs and GI infections in peri-urban slums in India; an area of research interest at the Childhood Infections and Pollution Consortium.
The 2015-16 Indian National Family Health Survey was used for data analysis on children aged 0-5 years. NFHS-4 includes data on slums in eight Indian cities, including Delhi, Meerut, Kolkata, Indore, Mumbai, Nagpur, Hyderabad, Chennai. The outcome variables, having fever and cough (FeCo) and diarrhoea in the last two weeks, were used to define the phenotype of infections; for this analysis fever and cough were measures of RTIs and diarrhoea was used to measure GI infections. Exposures considered in this study include variables at the individual, household and slum level and were all informed by existing literature. Multilevel models were used to estimate the association between exposures and outcomes variables; a prior of Cauchy distribution with a scale of 2.5 was selected when building the multilevel logistic models.
The total sample size of the number of children included in the analysis was n = 1,424. Data was imputed to account for missingness, and the original and imputed sample showing similar distributions. Results showed that diarrhoea and FeCo were both found to be more present in younger children than older children by a few months. In fixed effects, the odds of developing FeCo were higher if the mother perceives the child was born smaller than average (AOR 4.41, 1.13-17.17, P<0.05) at individual level. On the other hand, the odds of the diarrhoea outcome were lower if the child was older (AOR 0.97, 0.96-0.98, P<0.05) at individual level, and household's water source was public tap or standpipe (AOR 0.54, 0.31-0.96, P<0.05) at household level.

The developing countries have to share the disproportionate burden on maternal and infant health. In this review, we discuss the uncertainties resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, vertical transmission of the virus, and its effects on breastfeeding of the newborn. The problems of families and communities caring for mothers with COVID-19 and its impact on breastfeeding in newborns are discussed. The challenges posed by the pandemic have forced us to think and devise innovative solutions, including telemedicine help for antenatal counseling, breastfeeding education, and lactation support. Optimal utilization of resources and technology to find creative solutions at the individual and the community level will help in facilitating maternal-infant bonding soon after birth.

Patients in group-M received intranasal midazolam 0.2 mg/kg, whereas patients in group-D received intranasal dexmedetomidine 2 Œºg/kg prior to TTE under an adequately monitored anesthesia care. Onset and duration of sedation, heart rate, oxygen saturation, sonographer's, and parent's satisfaction scores were recorded.
All patients were successfully sedated for TTE. The average onset time, sedation time, awakening time and total time for Group-M were 7.3, 18.8, 29.51, 51 min and group-D were 10.1, 14.2, 24.9, 46.3 min, respectively and all were statistically significant (P < 0.001). TTE scan time of Group-M is 8.84 min and Group-D is 9.18 min and was statistically significant. Sonographer's and Parent's average satisfaction score for Group-M was 9.88, 10 and for Group-D was 7.64, 8.76, respectively, which were statistically significant (P < 0.001).
Intranasal midazolam and dexmedetomidine are safe and effective for sedation in TTE. Intranasal midazolam was found to be comparatively more effective in view of onset of action, sonographers, and parental satisfaction score, while sedation time, awakening time and total duration was significantly higher as compared to intranasal dexmedetomidine.",['Baby Panda Care'],"[{'lastname': 'Panda', 'firstname': 'Suvendu', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cardiac Anesthesia, U.N.

,"The problem of road traffic noise pollution has become a concern for both the public and the policy makers. Noise level was assessed in 12 different squares of Rourkela city during different specified times (7-10 a.m., 11 a.m.-2 p.m., 3-6 p.m., 7-10 p.m., 10 p.m.-12 midnight and 4-6 a.m.). Noise descriptors such as L,eq, traffic noise index, noise pollution level, noise climate, Lday, Levening, Lnight and Lden were assessed to reveal the extent of noise pollution due to heavy traffic in this city. The equivalent noise levels of all the 12 squares were found to be much beyond the permissible limit (70dB during day time and 55dB during night time). Appallingly, even the minimum L eq and NPL values were more than 82 dB and 96 dB during day time and 69 dB and 91 dB during night time respectively. Lden values of investigated squares ranged from 83.4 to 86.1 dB and were even more than the day time permissible limit of traffic noise. The prediction model was used in the present study to predict noise pollution level instead of Leq. Comparison of predicted with that of the actual measured data demonstrated that the model used for the prediction has the ability to calibrate the multicomponent traffic noise and yield reliable results close to that by direct measurement. Lastly, it is inferred that the dimension of the traffic generated noise pollution in Rourkela is critical.",['Dr. Panda Town'],"[{'lastname': 'Goswami', 'firstname': 'Shreerup', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Geology, Ravenshaw University, Cuttack-753 003, India. goswamishreerup@gmail.com'}, {'lastname': 'Swain', 'firstname': 'Bijay Kumar', 'initials': 'BK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Environmental Science, Utkal University, Bhubaneswar-751 004, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Panda', 'firstname': 'Santosh Kumar', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics, Dr J.N.College, Rasalpur; Balasore-756 021, India'}]",,,,Journal of environmental biology,[],,2014-02-25,24558802,,"Assessment, analysis and appraisal of road traffic noise pollution in Rourkela city, India.",7

,"We assume that all institutions and individuals involved in the organization of sport for children and young people should utilize the educational potential of sport. We assessed the quality of referee interactions with children during sports competitions in soccer. Based on the developmental theory and research suggesting that interactions between kids and adults are the primary mechanism of their development and learning, we focused on the quality of the referee-player interactions in terms of (1) emotional support, (2) game organization, and (3) instructional support. Twenty-five soccer referees who refereed matches for children aged 9-12 years were recruited. The Referee Educational Function Assessment Scoring System (REFASS) was used to assess the quality of the referee-player interactions. This tool was developed based on Classroom Assessment Scoring System-Upper Elementary. Regarding the REFASS dimensions, the mean scores for positive climate, Sensitivity, behavior management, content understanding and quality of feedback were in the medium range, while productivity and negative climate in the high range. In the case of the positive climate variable, the lowest mean ratings were recorded compared to other assessed dimensions. The assessments of the quality of referee-player interactions obtained for particular dimensions translated into the ratings for the specified domains. The highest ratings were given to game organization (6.0 ¬± 0.8; Me = 6.0), whereas the emotional support and instructional support were in the medium range (4.6 ¬± 1.5; Me = 4.5, and 5.2 ¬± 1.8; Me = 6.0, respectively). Referees are usually not aware of their pedagogical function and the complexity of their respective responsibilities. They are commonly considered to be ordinary technicians and evaluators of performance in competition. Based on the results, a postulate was formulated that referees should consciously perform a pedagogical function in the youth sport. Therefore, it is necessary to train them in educational methods and techniques appropriate to the age and needs of the child. The referees will then be prepared to take actions to prevent negative behavior of players on the field and to encourage prosocial behavior.",['Kids Educational Game 5'],"[{'lastname': 'Firek', 'firstname': 'Wies≈Çaw', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physical Education, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski University of Physical Education in Warsaw, 00-968 Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'P≈Çoszaj', 'firstname': 'Katarzyna', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physical Education, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski University of Physical Education in Warsaw, 00-968 Warsaw, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Czechowski', 'firstname': 'Marcin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Physical Education, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski University of Physical Education in Warsaw, 00-968 Warsaw, Poland.'}]",,,10.3390/ijerph17030905,International journal of environmental research and public health,"[None, 'assessment', 'educational practice', 'observational instruments', 'pedagogical function', 'referee', 'referee‚Äìplayer interactions', 'soccer']",,2020-02-07,32024100,,Pedagogical Function of Referees in Youth Sport: Assessment of the Quality of Referee-Player Interactions in Youth Soccer.,16
,"To examine the effect of the Virtual Sprouts intervention, an interactive multiplatform mobile gardening game, on dietary intake and psychosocial determinants of dietary behavior in minority youth.
In this quasi-experimental pilot intervention, 180 third-, fourth-, and fifth-grade students in Los Angeles Unified School District participated in a 3-week program that included three Virtual Sprouts gaming sessions, three in-school lessons, and three in-home activities, using a nutrition- and gardening-focused curriculum. Pre- and postintervention questionnaires were used to assess psychosocial determinants of dietary behavior, including knowledge about and self-efficacy to eat fruits and vegetables (FV). Data were collected on FV, whole grains, fiber, total sugar, added sugar, and energy from sugary beverages through the Block Kids Food Screener (""last week"" version) for Ages 2-17. Repeated measures analysis of covariance models was used for continuous outcomes, controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, school, and free school lunch.
After the intervention, the intervention group (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ116) compared with the control group (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ64) had a significantly improved self-efficacy to eat FV score (+1.6% vs. -10.3%, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.01), and an improved self-efficacy to cook FV score (+2.9% vs. -5.0%, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.05).

,"Home-based interventions have potential for improving early child development (ECD) in low-resource settings. The design of locally acceptable strategies requires an in-depth understanding of the household context. In this formative research study, we aimed to characterize the home play and learning environments of children 6-23‚Äâmonths of age from low-income households in peri-urban Lima, Peru.
Drawing on the developmental niche framework, we used quantitative and qualitative methods to understand children's physical and social settings, childcare practices, and caregiver perspectives. We conducted interviews, unstructured video-recorded observations, and spot-checks with 30 randomly selected caregiver-child dyads, 10 from each child age group of 6-11, 12-17, and 18-23‚Äâmonths of age, as well as key informant interviews with 12 daycare instructors. We analyzed the data for key trends and themes using Stata and ATLAS.ti and employed an adapted version of the Indicator of Parent-Child Interaction to evaluate the observations.
Children's social settings were characterized by multi-generational homes and the presence of siblings and cousins as play partners. Access to books and complex hand-eye coordination toys (e.g., puzzles, building blocks) in the home was limited (30.0 and 40.0%, respectively). Caregivers generally demonstrated low or inconsistent levels of interaction with their children; they rarely communicated using descriptive language or introduced novel, stimulating activities during play. Reading and telling stories to children were uncommon, yet 93.3% of caregivers reported singing to children daily. On average, caregivers ascribed a high learning value to reading books and playing with electronic toys (rated 9.7 and 9.1 out of 10, respectively), and perceived playing with everyday objects in the home as less beneficial (rated 6.8/10). Daycare instructors reinforced the problems posed by limited caregiver-child interaction and supported the use of songs for promoting ECD.
The features of the home learning environments highlighted here indicate several opportunities for intervention development to improve ECD. These include encouraging caregivers to communicate with children using full sentences and enhancing the use of everyday objects as toys. There is also great potential for leveraging song and music to encourage responsive caregiver-child interactions within the home setting.",['Baby puzzles'],"[{'lastname': 'Rothstein', 'firstname': 'Jessica D', 'initials': 'JD', 'affiliation': 'Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA. jrothstein@jhu.edu.'}, {'lastname': 'Buckland', 'firstname': 'Audrey J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Gagnier', 'firstname': 'Kristin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Science of Learning Institute, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ochoa', 'firstname': 'Mayra', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Asociaci√≥n Ben√©fica Proyectos en Inform√°tica, Salud, Medicina, y Agricultura (PRISMA), Lima, Peru.'}, {'lastname': 'Allen-Valley', 'firstname': 'Aliya', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jivapong', 'firstname': 'Belinda', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Cabrera', 'firstname': 'Lilia Z', 'initials': 'LZ', 'affiliation': 'Asociaci√≥n Ben√©fica Proyectos en Inform√°tica, Salud, Medicina, y Agricultura (PRISMA), Lima, Peru.'}, {'lastname': 'Leontsini', 'firstname': 'Elli', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of International Health, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Fisher', 'firstname': 'Kelly R', 'initials': 'KR', 'affiliation': 'Science of Learning Institute, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.'}]",,,10.1186/s12889-020-10119-3,BMC public health,"['Early child development', 'Formative research', 'Learning environment', 'Mixed methods', 'Peri-urban', 'Peru']",,2021-01-11,33422022,"Children's social settings were characterized by multi-generational homes and the presence of siblings and cousins as play partners.

,"Developmental cognitive neuroscience is flourishing but there are new challenges and new questions to be asked. I argue that we need a bigger picture and an evolutionary framework. This brings some challenges, such as the need to rewrite the old story of nature and nurture, and the need to systematically investigate innate predispositions. While brain imaging has provided some splendid insights and new puzzles to solve, its limitations must not be ignored. Can they help us to find out more about the extent to which the infant brain already configures the adult brain? Can we find out why neurodevelopmental disorders often have severe consequences on cognition and behaviour, despite the mitigating force of brain plasticity? I wish to encourage researchers of the future to take risks by letting their imagination inspire theories to pursue hard questions.

,"Acute or chronic irreversible respiratory failure may occur in patients undergoing pneumonectomy. Aim of this study was to determine transcriptome expression changes after experimental pneumonectomy in swine model. Experimental left pneumonectomy was performed in five pigs under general anaesthesia. Both the resected and the remaining lung, after 60 post-operative completely uneventful days, underwent genome-wide bulk RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq).
Histological analysis showed dilation of air spaces and rupture of interalveolar septa. In addition, mild inflammation, no fibrosis, radial stretch of the bronchus, strong enlargement of airspaces and thinning of the blood supply were observed. Bioinformatic analyses of bulk RNA-Seq data identified 553 Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) at adjusted P-value below 0.001, between pre- and post-pneumonectomy. The top 10 up-regulated DEGs were Edn1, Areg, Havcr2, Gadd45g, Depp1, Cldn4, Atf3, Myc, Gadd45b, Socs3; the top 10 down-regulated DEGs were Obscn, Cdkn2b, ENSSSCG00000015738, Prrt2, Amer1, Flrt3, Efnb2, Tox3, Znf793, Znf365.

,"Tsetse flies are the major vectors of human trypanosomiasis of the form Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense and T.b.gambiense. They are widely spread across the sub-Saharan Africa and rendering a lot of challenges to both human and animal health. This stresses effective agricultural production and productivity in Africa. Delimiting the extent and magnitude of tsetse coverage has been a challenge over decades due to limited resources and unsatisfactory technology. In a bid to overcome these limitations, this study attempted to explore modelling skills that can be applied to spatially estimate tsetse abundance in the country using limited tsetse data and a set of remote-sensed environmental variables.
Entomological data for the period 2008-2018 as used in the model were obtained from various sources and systematically assembled using a structured protocol. Data harmonisation for the purposes of responsiveness and matching was carried out. The key tool for tsetse trapping was itemized as pyramidal trap in many instances and biconical trap in others. Based on the spatially explicit assembled data, we ran two regression models; standard Poisson and Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP), to explore the associations between tsetse abundance in Uganda and several environmental and climatic covariates. The covariate data were constituted largely by satellite sensor data in form of meteorological and vegetation surrogates in association with elevation and land cover data. We finally used the Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression model to predict tsetse abundance due to its superiority over the standard Poisson after model fitting and testing using the Vuong Non-Nested statistic.
A total of 1,187 tsetse sampling points were identified and considered as representative for the country. The model results indicated the significance and level of responsiveness of each covariate in influencing tsetse abundance across the study area. Woodland vegetation, elevation, temperature, rainfall, and dry season normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) were important in determining tsetse abundance and spatial distribution at varied scales. The resultant prediction map shows scaled tsetse abundance with estimated fitted numbers ranging from 0 to 59 flies per trap per day (FTD). Tsetse abundance was found to be largest at low elevations, in areas of high vegetative activity, in game parks, forests and shrubs during the dry season. There was very limited responsiveness of selected predictors to tsetse abundance during the wet season, matching the known fact that tsetse disperse most significantly during wet season.
A methodology was advanced to enable compilation of entomological data for 10 years, which supported the generation of tsetse abundance maps for Uganda through modelling. Our findings indicate the spatial distribution of the G. f. fuscipes as; low 0-5 FTD (48%), medium 5.1-35 FTD (18%) and high 35.1-60 FTD (34%) grounded on seasonality. This approach, amidst entomological data shortages due to limited resources and absence of expertise, can be adopted to enable mapping of the vector to provide better decision support towards designing and implementing targeted tsetse and tsetse-transmitted African trypanosomiasis control strategies.",['Bubbu School - My Cute Pets | Animal School Game'],"[{'lastname': 'Mugenyi', 'firstname': 'Albert', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Coordinating Office for Control of Trypanosomiasis in Uganda, Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, Kampala, Uganda.\nSchool of Biomedical Sciences, Edinburgh Medical School, College of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Muhanguzi', 'firstname': 'Dennis', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'College of Veterinary Medicine Animal Resources and Biosecurity, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.'}, {'lastname': 'Hendrickx', 'firstname': 'Guy', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Avia-GIS, Zoersel, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Nicolas', 'firstname': 'Ga√´lle', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Avia-GIS, Zoersel, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Waiswa', 'firstname': 'Charles', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Coordinating Office for Control of Trypanosomiasis in Uganda, Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and Fisheries, Kampala, Uganda.\nCollege of Veterinary Medicine Animal Resources and Biosecurity, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.'}, {'lastname': 'Torr', 'firstname': 'Steve', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Vector Biology, Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Liverpool, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Welburn', 'firstname': 'Susan Christina', 'initials': 'SC', 'affiliation': 'School of Biomedical Sciences, Edinburgh Medical School, College of Medicine and Veterinary Medicine, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.\nInternational Campus, ZJU-UoE Institute, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Atkinson', 'firstname': 'Peter M', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': 'Faculty of Science and Technology, Lancaster University, Lancaster, United Kingdom.'}]",,,10.1371/journal.pntd.0009820,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,[],,2021-12-07,34871296,"A total of 1,187 tsetse sampling points were identified and considered as representative for the country.

,"Urbanization is one of the most prevalent drivers of biodiversity loss, yet few taxonomic groups are remarkably successful at adapting to urban environments. We systematically surveyed the global literature on the effects of urbanization on species of family Corvidae (crows, choughs, jackdaws, jays, magpies, nutcrackers, ravens, rooks, treepies) to assess the occurrence of corvids in urban environments and the factors affecting their success. We found a total of 424 primary research articles, and the number of articles has increased exponentially since the 1970s. Most studies were carried out in cities of Europe and North America (45.5% and 31.4%, respectively) and were directed on a single species (75.2). We found that 30 corvid species (23% of 133 total) regularly occur in urban environments. The majority (72%) of the studies reported positive effects of urbanization on corvids, with 85% of studies detecting population increases and 64% of studies detecting higher breeding success with urbanization. Of the factors proposed to explain corvids' success (availability of nesting sites and food sources, low predation and persecution), food availability coupled with diet shifts emerged as the most important factors promoting Corvidae to live in urban settings. The breeding of corvids in urban environments was further associated with earlier nesting, similar or larger clutches, lower hatching but higher fledging success, reduced home range size and limited territoriality, increased tolerance towards humans and increasing frequency of conflicts with humans. Despite geographic and taxonomic biases in our literature sample, our review indicates that corvids show both flexibility in resource use and behavioral plasticity that enable them to exploit novel resources for nesting and feeding. Corvids can thus be urban exploiters of the large-scale modifications of ecosystems caused by urbanization.",['Bubbu School - My Cute Pets | Animal School Game'],"[{'lastname': 'Benmazouz', 'firstname': 'Isma', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Animal Husbandry Doctoral School, University of Debrecen, 4032 Debrecen, Hungary.'}, {'lastname': 'Jokim√§ki', 'firstname': 'Jukka', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Arctic Centre, University of Lapland, 96300 Rovaniemi, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Lengyel', 'firstname': 'Szabolcs', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Tisza Research, Institute of Aquatic Ecology, Centre for Ecological Research, E√∂tv√∂s Lor√°nd Research Network, 4026 Debrecen, Hungary.'}, {'lastname': 'Juh√°sz', 'firstname': 'Lajos', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nature Conservation Zoology and Game Management, University of Debrecen, 4032 Debrecen, Hungary.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaisanlahti-Jokim√§ki', 'firstname': 'Marja-Liisa', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'Arctic Centre, University of Lapland, 96300 Rovaniemi, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Kardos', 'firstname': 'G√°bor', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Metagenomics, University of Debrecen, 4032 Debrecen, Hungary.'}, {'lastname': 'Pal√°di', 'firstname': 'Petra', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Animal Husbandry Doctoral School, University of Debrecen, 4032 Debrecen, Hungary.'}, {'lastname': 'K√∂v√©r', 'firstname': 'L√°szl√≥', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nature Conservation Zoology and Game Management, University of Debrecen, 4032 Debrecen, Hungary.'}]",,,10.3390/ani11113226,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,"['Corvidae', 'adaptation', 'anthropogenic', 'habitat selection', 'life history trait', 'urbanization gradient']",,2021-11-28,34827957,,Corvids in Urban Environments: A Systematic Global Literature Review.,10

,"Adults recognize talkers better when the talkers speak a familiar language than when they speak an unfamiliar language. This language familiarity effect (LFE) demonstrates the inseparable nature of linguistic and indexical information in adult spoken language processing. Relatively little is known about children's integration of linguistic and indexical information in speech. For example, to date, only one study has explored the LFE in infants. Here, we sought to better understand the maturation of speech processing abilities in infants by replicating this earlier study using a more stringent experimental design (eliminating a potential voice-language confound), a different test population (English- rather than Dutch-learning infants), and a new language pairing (English vs. Polish rather than Dutch vs. Italian or Japanese). Furthermore, we explored the language exposure conditions required for infants to develop an LFE for a formerly unfamiliar language. We hypothesized based on previous studies (including the perceptual narrowing literature) that infants might develop an LFE more readily than would adults. Although our findings replicate those of the earlier study-demonstrating that the LFE is robust in 7.5-month-olds-we found no evidence that infants need less language exposure than do adults to develop an LFE. We concluded that both infants and adults need extensive (potentially live) exposure to an unfamiliar language before talker identification in that language improves. Moreover, our study suggests that the LFE is likely rooted in early emerging phonology rather than shared lexical knowledge and that infants already closely resemble adults in their processing of linguistic and indexical information.

,"The significance of effective interprofessional teamwork to improve the quality of care has been widely recognised. Effective interprofessional teamwork calls on good collaboration between professionals and patients, coordination between professionals, and the development of teamwork over time. Effective development of teams also requires support from the wider organisational context. In a Dutch village, healthcare professionals work closely together, and mutual consultations as well as interprofessional meetings take place on a regular basis. The network was created as a precondition for sustainable interprofessional teamwork in elderly care. However, several external barriers were experienced regarding the supportive structure and cooperative attitude of the healthcare insurer and municipality. The aim of the article is to examine these experience-based issues regarding internal organisation, perspective, and definition of effective teamwork. Complicating factors refer to finding the right key figures, and the different perspectives on team development and team effectiveness. Our conclusion is that the organisation of healthcare insurance companies needs to implement fundamental changes to facilitate an interprofessional care approach. Furthermore, municipalities should work on their vision of the needs and benefits of a fruitful collaboration with interprofessional healthcare teams.

As single indicators, we identified lameness, body condition score (BCS), qualitative behaviour assessment (QBA), and human-animal relationship (HAR) tests with substantial evidence for sufficient validity to assess welfare in goats. A multitude of indicators (e.g., hair coat condition) was studied less intensively but was successfully used for welfare assessments. For some indicators (e.g., oblivion, lying behaviour), we highlight the need for future research to further validate them or to optimise their use in on-farm welfare assessments.

,"To start milk production, dairy goats need to give birth at least once. While most female kids are reared to become the next generation of dairy goats, only a small proportion of male kids (buck kids) are reared with reproduction aims. The market for buck kid meat, especially within Northern European countries, is currently relatively small compared to the number of bucks born. Therefore, the purposes for buck kids are limited and a substantial proportion of buck kid meat is used for pet food. Due to the limited economic value of buck kids, farmers are faced with a dilemma. Although raising bucks costs more money than it yields, the birth of kids is a prerequisite for production of milk and should be seen as an investment for business-wise healthy dairy goat farming. In that perspective, dairy goat farmers have an ethical responsibility toward buck kids, as well. In this paper, we compare various scenarios of dealing with the issue of surplus male animals. We provide recommendations for the rearing of buck kids based on the sector's experience and current practice in the Netherlands. Reducing the number of surplus (male) offspring, e.g., by an optimized prolonged lactation management and/or by artificial insemination with sex-sorted semen, could alleviate the issue of low value buck kids. Killing surplus animals before or directly after birth, on the other hand, is met with increasing societal scrutiny. Initiatives to propagate a market for buck kid meat for human consumption are important to enable a suitable and sustainable production system. To maintain the health and welfare of goat kids, amongst other factors, sufficient and good quality colostrum, milk, and an appropriate diet as they grow older, needs to be provided. One option to assure the safeguarding of health and welfare of all goat kids are quality assurance schemes for milk production. These schemes make dairy farmers accountable for the health and welfare of all kids in the rearing period, including the provision of colostrum and adequate care for newborn buck kids.

,"Aural hematomas are not uncommon in ruminants' clinical practice; however, there is a lack of information regarding their management in newborn ruminants, especially for complicated cases with rupture of the hematoma and secondary ear pinna necrosis.
A 3-day-old orphan goat kid was admitted due to swelling on the left ear pinna and trauma on the right pina caused by biting by other goats. The swelling on the left ear which was located at the convex surface was soft, painless, and fluid-filled, suggestive of aural hematoma located at the convex surface. The right pinna was swollen, bleeding, and extremely painful at palpation. The skin was necrotized at the distal 2/3rd of the convex surface and the 1/2 of the concave surface. Underneath the necrotized skin of the convex surface, blood, and blood clots were trapped, and there was a pocket between the remaining normal skin and the cartilage indicating possible rupture of aural hematoma. The kid was surgically treated under general anesthesia with xylazine and ketamine. The aural hematoma was drained by the convex surface using a Penrose tube after flushing the cavity with 2 mg dexamethasone. The trauma of the right pinna was left to heal by secondary intention after resection of all necrotized, edematous tissues, and blood clots. Post-surgery, the animal was treated with parenteral antibiotic administration and daily application of a topical antiseptic solution. The Penrose tube was removed after 5 days, and the animal recovered uneventfully.
The present case indicates that aural hematoma can occur in newborn goat kids secondary to ear pinna biting and might evolve to pinna necrosis. In addition, tube drainage after flushing the cavity with corticosteroids appears to be an effective treatment approach without requiring bandaging post-operatively.",['Animals Farm For Kids'],"[{'lastname': 'Katsoulos', 'firstname': 'Panagiotis D', 'initials': 'PD', 'affiliation': 'Clinic of Farm Animals, School of Veterinary Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Dedousi', 'firstname': 'Anna', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Veterinary Research Institute, Hellenic Agricultural Organization DIMITRA, Thermi, Thessaloniki, Greece.'}]",,,10.5455/OVJ.2021.v11.i3.7,Open veterinary journal,"['Aural hematoma', 'Ear pinna necrosis', 'Goat kid', 'Penrose drainage', 'Surgery']",,2021-11-02,34722199,,Surgical management of bilateral ear pinna lesions associated with traumatic aural hematoma in a 3-day-old goat kid.,18
,"Newborn dairy ruminants are usually separated from their dams after birth and fed on milk replacer. This lack of contact with adult animals may hinder the rumen microbiological and physiological development. This study evaluates the effects of rearing newborn goat kids in contact with adult companions on the rumen development. Thirty-two newborn goat kids were randomly allocated to two experimental groups which were reared either in the absence (CTL) or in the presence of non-lactating adult goats (CMP) and weaned at 7 weeks of age. Blood and rumen samples were taken at 5, 7, and 9 weeks of age to evaluate blood metabolites and rumen microbial fermentation. Next-generation sequencing was carried out on rumen samples collected at 7 weeks of age. Results showed that CTL kids lacked rumen protozoa, whereas CMP kids had an abundant and complex protozoal community as well as higher methanogen abundance which positively correlated with the body weight and blood Œ≤-hydroxybutyrate as indicators of the physiological development. CMP kids also had a more diverse bacterial community (+132 ASVs) and a different structure of the bacterial and methanogen communities than CTL kids. The core rumen bacterial community in CMP animals had 53 more ASVs than that of CTL animals. Furthermore, the number of ASVs shared with the adult companions was over 4-fold higher in CMP kids than in CTL kids. Greater levels of early rumen colonizers Proteobacteria and Spirochaetes were found in CTL kids, while CMP kids had higher levels of Bacteroidetes and other less abundant taxa (Veillonellaceae, Cyanobacteria, and Selenomonas). These findings suggest that the presence of adult companions facilitated the rumen microbial development prior to weaning. This accelerated microbial development had no effect on the animal growth, but CMP animals presented higher rumen pH and butyrate (+45%) and ammonia concentrations than CTL kids, suggesting higher fibrolytic and proteolytic activities. CMP kids also had higher blood Œ≤-hydroxybutyrate (+79%) and lower blood glucose concentrations (-23%) at weaning, indicating an earlier metabolic development which could favor the transition from pre-ruminant to ruminant after the weaning process. Further research is needed to determine the effects of this intervention in more challenging farm conditions.",['Animals Farm For Kids'],"[{'lastname': 'Palma-Hidalgo', 'firstname': 'Juan Manuel', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Estaci√≥n Experimental del Zaid√≠n (CSIC), Granada, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Y√°√±ez-Ruiz', 'firstname': 'David R', 'initials': 'DR', 'affiliation': 'Estaci√≥n Experimental del Zaid√≠n (CSIC), Granada, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Jim√©nez', 'firstname': 'Elisabeth', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Estaci√≥n Experimental del Zaid√≠n (CSIC), Granada, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Mart√≠n-Garc√≠a', 'firstname': 'A Ignacio', 'initials': 'AI', 'affiliation': 'Estaci√≥n Experimental del Zaid√≠n (CSIC), Granada, Spain.'}, {'lastname': 'Belanche', 'firstname': 'Alejandro', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Estaci√≥n Experimental del Zaid√≠n (CSIC), Granada, Spain.\nDepartment of Animal Production and Food Sciences, AgriFood Institute of Aragon (IA2), University of Zaragoza-CITA, Zaragoza, Spain.'}]",,"Copyright ¬© 2021 Palma-Hidalgo, Y√°√±ez-Ruiz, Jim√©nez, Mart√≠n-Garc√≠a and Belanche.",10.3389/fvets.2021.706592,Frontiers in veterinary science,"['bacteria', 'methanogens', 'protozoa', 'rumen colonization', 'weaning']",,2021-09-25,34557542,,Presence of Adult Companion Goats Favors the Rumen Microbial and Functional Development in Artificially Reared Kids.,18

,"Given the difficulty in factoring out typical age effects from subtle Alzheimer's disease (AD) effects on brain structure, identification of very early, as well as younger preclinical ""at-risk"" individuals has unique challenges. We examined whether age-correction procedures could be used to better identify individuals at very early potential risk from adults who did not have any existing cognitive diagnosis. First, we obtained cross-sectional age effects for each structural feature using data from a selected portion of the Human Connectome Project Aging (HCP-A) cohort. After age detrending, we weighted AD structural deterioration with patterns quantified from data of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Support vector machine was then used to classify individuals with brains that most resembled atrophy in AD across the entire HCP-A sample. Additionally, we iteratively adjusted the pipeline by removing individuals classified as AD-like from the HCP-A cohort to minimize atypical brain structural contributions to the age detrending. The classifier had a mean cross-validation accuracy of 94.0% for AD recognition. It also could identify mild cognitive impairment with more severe AD-specific biomarkers and worse cognition. In an independent HCP-A cohort, 8.8% were identified as AD-like, and they trended toward worse cognition. An ""AD risk"" score derived from the machine learning models also significantly correlated with cognition. This work provides a proof of concept for the potential to use structural brain imaging to identify asymptomatic individuals at young ages who show structural brain patterns similar to AD and are potentially at risk for a future clinical disorder.",['Lumosity: Brain Training'],"[{'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Binyin', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology and Institute of Neurology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.\nMGH/MIT/HMS Athinoula A.

,"The rising prevalence rates of age-related cognitive impairment are a worldwide public concern, bringing about a surge in the number of ""brain training"" programs commercially available to the general public. Numerous companies advertise that their products improve memory and protect against cognitive decline, though researchers have voiced concerns regarding the validity of such claims. To address this issue, the current meta-analytic investigation examined evidence from 43 studies (encompassing 2,636 participants) to evaluate the efficacy of commercial training programs within two separate populations: healthy older adults and older adults with mild cognitive-impairment (MCI). Seven programs were identified: BrainGymmer, BrainHQ, CogMed, CogniFit, Dakim, Lumosity, and MyBrainTrainer. Analyses yielded small, significant near-transfer effects for both healthy and MCI samples. Far-transfer was not observed for the MCI sample, whereas a small, significant effect was found for subjective but not objective measures of far-transfer in the healthy sample. Analyses of individual domains (combining near-and far-transfer outcomes) yielded significant transfer to executive-functioning, memory, and processing-speed in healthy older adults. After adjusting for publication bias, only the effect size for processing speed remained significant. Transfer to attention, objective everyday functioning, fluid-intelligence, and visuospatial domains was not significant. Thus, whilst ""brain training"" may be suitable for enjoyment and entertainment purposes, there is currently insufficient empirical evidence to support that such training can improve memory, general cognition, or everyday functioning. This area of research is still in its infancy and warrants further investigation to provide more substantial evidence regarding the efficacy of this rapidly expanding industry.",['Lumosity: Brain Training'],"[{'lastname': 'Nguyen', 'firstname': 'Lan', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'School of Applied Psychology, Griffith University, Griffith University, Gold Coast, QLD 4222, Australia.

,"Surface rendering of MRI brain scans may lead to identification of the participant through facial characteristics. In this study, we evaluate three methods that overwrite voxels containing privacy-sensitive information: Face Masking, FreeSurfer defacing, and FSL defacing. We included structural T1-weighted MRI scans of children, young adults and older adults. For the young adults, test-retest data were included with a 1-week interval. The effects of the de-identification methods were quantified using different statistics to capture random variation and systematic noise in measures obtained through the FreeSurfer processing pipeline. Face Masking and FSL defacing impacted brain voxels in some scans especially in younger participants. FreeSurfer defacing left brain tissue intact in all cases. FSL defacing and FreeSurfer defacing preserved identifiable characteristics around the eyes or mouth in some scans. For all de-identification methods regional brain measures of subcortical volume, cortical volume, cortical surface area, and cortical thickness were on average highly replicable when derived from original versus de-identified scans with average regional correlations >.90 for children, young adults, and older adults. Small systematic biases were found that incidentally resulted in significantly different brain measures after de-identification, depending on the studied subsample, de-identification method, and brain metric. In young adults, test-retest intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were comparable for original scans and de-identified scans with average regional ICCs >.90 for (sub)cortical volume and cortical surface area and ICCs >.80 for cortical thickness.

However, clinical use of functional connectivity biomarkers is impeded by unreliable estimates of individual functional connectomes and lack of generalizability of models predicting cognitive outcomes from connectivity. To address these issues, we combine the frameworks of connectome predictive modeling and differential identifiability. Using the combined framework, we show that enhancing the individual fingerprint of resting state functional connectomes leads to robust identification of functional networks associated to cognitive outcomes and also improves prediction of cognitive outcomes from functional connectomes. Using a comprehensive spectrum of cognitive outcomes associated to Alzheimer's disease (AD), we identify and characterize functional networks associated to specific cognitive deficits exhibited in AD. This combined framework is an important step in making individual level predictions of cognition from resting state functional connectomes and in understanding the relationship between cognition and connectivity.",['Lumosity: Brain Training'],"[{'lastname': 'Svaldi', 'firstname': 'Diana O', 'initials': 'DO', 'affiliation': 'Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Go√±i', 'firstname': 'Joaqu√≠n', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA.\nPurdue Institute for Integrative Neuroscience, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA.\nWeldon School of Biomedical Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Abbas', 'firstname': 'Kausar', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA.\nPurdue Institute for Integrative Neuroscience, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Amico', 'firstname': 'Enrico', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'School of Industrial Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA.\nPurdue Institute for Integrative Neuroscience, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Clark', 'firstname': 'David G', 'initials': 'DG', 'affiliation': 'Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Muralidharan', 'firstname': 'Charanya', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Dzemidzic', 'firstname': 'Mario', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'West', 'firstname': 'John D', 'initials': 'JD', 'affiliation': 'Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Risacher', 'firstname': 'Shannon L', 'initials': 'SL', 'affiliation': 'Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Saykin', 'firstname': 'Andrew J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Apostolova', 'firstname': 'Liana G', 'initials': 'LG', 'affiliation': 'Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.'}]",,¬© 2021 The Authors.

,"Among the non-pharmacological methods under development for maintaining cognitive function across the lifespan is computerized cognitive training (CCT). There has been considerable interest in using CCT to slow or remediate age-related cognitive decline, both normal and pathological. Toward these ends, it would be useful to know how the effects of CCT on cognitive function vary over the course of normal cognitive aging. Are there changes in either 1) the overall efficacy of CCT or 2) which cognitive faculties are affected? To address these two questions, we reanalyzed results from a large online study by Hardy et al. (1) of 4,715 adults between 18 and 80 that examined effects of CCT on both a neuropsychological test battery and self-reported ratings of cognition and affect in daily living. Combined across all participants, Hardy et al. found greater improvement on both types of assessment following 10 weeks of CCT with the commercial program Lumosity, as compared to practice with a control activity involving computerized crossword puzzles. The present study compared the size of these effects on the older (50-80) and younger (18-49) participants. To address the question of overall efficacy, we examined CCT effects (treatment minus control) on overall performance of the test battery and mean rating. No significant difference on either measure was found between the two age cohorts. To address the question of whether the same magnitude of overall effects on both age cohorts was due to equivalent effects on the same set of underlying cognitive functions, we examined the patterns of CCT effects across individual subtests and rated items. These patterns did not differ significantly between the two age cohorts. Our findings suggest that benefits from CCT can occur to a similar degree and in a similar way across an extended part of the adult lifespan. Moreover, the overall effects of CCT delivered over the internet were of the same small to medium size as those typically found in the lab or clinic. Besides improving access and reducing the cost of CCT for older adults, delivery over the internet makes long-term training more practicable, which could potentially yield larger benefits.",['Lumosity: Brain Training'],"[{'lastname': 'Ng', 'firstname': 'Nicole F', 'initials': 'NF', 'affiliation': 'Department of Research and Development, Lumos Labs, San Francisco, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Osman', 'firstname': 'Allen M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Research and Development, Lumos Labs, San Francisco, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Kerlan', 'firstname': 'Kelsey R', 'initials': 'KR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Research and Development, Lumos Labs, San Francisco, CA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Doraiswamy', 'firstname': 'P Murali', 'initials': 'PM', 'affiliation': 'Duke University School of Medicine, Neurocognitive Disorders Program, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, Durham, NC, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Schafer', 'firstname': 'Robert J', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Research and Development, Lumos Labs, San Francisco, CA, United States.'}]",,"Copyright ¬© 2021 Ng, Osman, Kerlan, Doraiswamy and Schafer.",10.3389/fneur.2020.564317,Frontiers in neurology,"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'age-related cognitive decline', 'cognitive aging', 'computerized cognitive training', 'digital health', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'telemedicine']",,2021-01-29,33505344,,Computerized Cognitive Training by Healthy Older and Younger Adults: Age Comparisons of Overall Efficacy and Selective Effects on Cognition.,22

,"Detecting early pathological cognitive decline is critical for dementia and aging-related research and clinical diagnostics. Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) is commonly used to measure episodic verbal memory. The test requires participants to learn a list of 15 words over several trials. Since multiple testing is often required to detect cognitive decline, but repeating the same test can bias results, we developed 10 German AVLT word lists.
We randomly assigned the lists to 4,000 participants (aged 30-94¬†years) from a population-based cohort to test their comparability, as well as aging effects and sex differences.
Nine lists were highly comparable, with only one being slightly more difficult. Recall performance decreased on average by 0.6-1.1 words per trial per decade of age. Perseveration errors decreased with increasing age. Women remembered on average between 0.8 and 1.5 words per trial more than men, regardless of age. Women also outperformed men in the sum of Trials 1-5, learning over trials, retroactive inhibition, and false-positive and interference errors. Proactive inhibition remained stable across age and was unaffected by sex.

,"To acquire language, infants must learn to segment words from running speech. A significant body of experimental research shows that infants use multiple cues to do so; however, little research has comprehensively examined the distribution of such cues in naturalistic speech. We conducted a comprehensive corpus analysis of German child-directed speech (CDS) using data from the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES) database, investigating the availability of word stress, transitional probabilities (TPs), and lexical and sublexical frequencies as potential cues for word segmentation. Seven hours of data (~15,000 words) were coded, representing around an average day of speech to infants. The analysis revealed that for 97% of words, primary stress was carried by the initial syllable, implicating stress as a reliable cue to word onset in German CDS. Word identity was also marked by TPs between syllables, which were higher within than between words, and higher for backwards than forwards transitions. Words followed a Zipfian-like frequency distribution, and over two-thirds of words (78%) were monosyllabic. Of the 50 most frequent words, 82% were function words, which accounted for 47% of word tokens in the entire corpus. Finally, 15% of all utterances comprised single words. These results give rich novel insights into the availability of segmentation cues in German CDS, and support the possibility that infants draw on multiple converging cues to segment their input. The data, which we make openly available to the research community, will help guide future experimental investigations on this topic.","['Learn English - 15,000 Words']","[{'lastname': 'St√§rk', 'firstname': 'Katja', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Language Development Department, Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Kidd', 'firstname': 'Evan', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Language Development Department, Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, The Netherlands.\nResearch School of Psychology, The Australian National University, Australia.\nARC Centre of Excellence for the Dynamics of Language, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Frost', 'firstname': 'Rebecca L A', 'initials': 'RLA', 'affiliation': 'Language Development Department, Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, The Netherlands.'}]",,,10.1177/0023830920979016,Language and speech,"['German', 'Language acquisition', 'child-directed speech', 'distributional cues', 'speech segmentation']",,2021-02-02,33517856,,Word Segmentation Cues in German Child-Directed Speech: A Corpus Analysis.,15
,"Knowledge representation has gained in relevance as data from the ubiquitous digitization of behaviors amass and academia and industry seek methods to understand and reason about the information they encode. Success in this pursuit has emerged with data from natural language, where skip-grams and other linear connectionist models of distributed representation have surfaced scrutable relational structures which have also served as artifacts of anthropological interest. Natural language is, however, only a fraction of the big data deluge. Here we show that latent semantic structure can be informed by behavioral data and that domain knowledge can be extracted from this structure through visualization and a novel mapping of the text descriptions of elements onto this behaviorally informed representation. In this study, we use the course enrollment histories of 124,000 students at a public university to learn vector representations of its courses. From these course selection informed representations, a notable 88% of course attribute information was recovered, as well as 40% of course relationships constructed from prior domain knowledge and evaluated by analogy (e.g., Math 1B is to Honors Math 1B as Physics 7B is to Honors Physics 7B). To aid in interpretation of the learned structure, we create a semantic interpolation, translating course vectors to a bag-of-words of their respective catalog descriptions via regression. We find that representations learned from enrollment histories resolved courses to a level of semantic fidelity exceeding that of their catalog descriptions, revealing nuanced content differences between similar courses, as well as accurately describing departments the dataset had no course descriptions for. We end with a discussion of the possible mechanisms by which this semantic structure may be informed and implications for the nascent research and practice of data science.","['Learn English - 15,000 Words']","[{'lastname': 'Pardos', 'firstname': 'Zachary A', 'initials': 'ZA', 'affiliation': 'Graduate School of Education, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.'}, {'lastname': 'Nam', 'firstname': 'Andrew Joo Hun', 'initials': 'AJH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America.'}]",,,10.1371/journal.pone.0233207,PloS one,[],,2020-10-01,32997664,,A university map of course knowledge.,15
,"The language we use over the course of conversation changes as we establish common ground and learn what our partner finds meaningful. Here we draw upon recent advances in natural language processing to provide a finer-grained characterization of the dynamics of this learning process. We release an open corpus (>15,000 utterances) of extended dyadic interactions in a classic repeated reference game task where pairs of participants had to coordinate on how to refer to initially difficult-to-describe tangram stimuli. We find that different pairs discover a wide variety of idiosyncratic but efficient and stable solutions to the problem of reference. Furthermore, these conventions are shaped by the communicative context: words that are more discriminative in the initial context (i.e., that are used for one target more than others) are more likely to persist through the final repetition. Finally, we find systematic structure in how a speaker's referring expressions become more efficient over time: Syntactic units drop out in clusters following positive feedback from the listener, eventually leaving short labels containing open-class parts of speech. These findings provide a higher resolution look at the quantitative dynamics of ad hoc convention formation and support further development of computational models of learning in communication.","['Learn English - 15,000 Words']","[{'lastname': 'Hawkins', 'firstname': 'Robert D', 'initials': 'RD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Stanford University.'}, {'lastname': 'Frank', 'firstname': 'Michael C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Stanford University.'}, {'lastname': 'Goodman', 'firstname': 'Noah D', 'initials': 'ND', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Stanford University.\nDepartment of Computer Science, Stanford University.'}]",,"¬© 2020 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.",10.1111/cogs.12845,Cognitive science,"['Conventions', 'Interaction', 'Language use', 'Meaning', 'Natural language processing', 'Semantic embeddings', 'Syntax']",,2020-06-05,32496603,,Characterizing the Dynamics of Learning in Repeated Reference Games.,15

,"Aiming at the problem of low student enthusiasm in piano teaching, this work tried to apply ""Pygmalion effect"" to piano teaching from the perspective of educational psychology. Forty-five students were chosen from nine classes in grades 2, 4, and 6 of a central elementary school in Beijing City using experimental research, and the experimental group and the control group were set up. A questionnaire was adopted to conduct the pre-test and post-test of the experiment, which were done to analyze the factors that affect the attitude of students toward music learning and the effect of piano teaching. The results show that the encouragement level of the piano teacher and the enthusiasm of the students in the piano course were significantly correlated at the 0.01 level. There was also a significant correlation between self-efficacy and student piano learning enthusiasm at the 0.01 level. Furthermore, the pre-test and post-test results showed that the students in the experimental group of each grade generally performed much better in piano learning than the students in the control group, which proves that the ""Pygmalion effect"" can play an excellent interventional role in piano teaching. In this research, the value of ""Pygmalion effect"" in the educational psychology of piano music education in primary schools was deeply studied to explore the possibility of a novel piano teaching model. The research results show that teacher encouragement can stimulate the subjective initiative of students and make them perform better in piano learning.

,"Human behavior is inherently multimodal and relies on sensorimotor integration. This is evident when pianists exhibit activity in motor and premotor cortices, as part of a dorsal pathway, while listening to a familiar piece of music, or when na√Øve participants learn to play simple patterns on the piano. Here we investigated the interaction between multimodal learning and dorsal-stream activity over the course of four weeks in ten skilled pianists by adopting a naturalistic data-driven analysis approach. We presented the pianists with audio-only, video-only and audiovisual recordings of a piano sonata during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) before and after they had learned to play the sonata by heart for a total of four weeks. We followed the learning process and its outcome with questionnaires administered to the pianists, one piano instructor following their training, and seven external expert judges. The similarity of the pianists' brain activity during stimulus presentations was examined before and after learning by means of inter-subject correlation (ISC) analysis. After learning, an increased ISC was found in the pianists while watching the audiovisual performance, particularly in motor and premotor regions of the dorsal stream. While these brain structures have previously been associated with learning simple audio-motor sequences, our findings are the first to suggest their involvement in learning a complex and demanding audiovisual-motor task.

,"Anxiety results in sub-optimal motor learning, but the precise mechanisms through which this effect occurs remain unknown. Using a motor sequence learning paradigm with separate phases for initial exploration and reward-based learning, we show that anxiety states in humans impair learning by attenuating the update of reward estimates. Further, when such estimates are perceived as unstable over time (volatility), anxiety constrains adaptive behavioral changes. Neurally, anxiety during initial exploration increased the amplitude and the rate of long bursts of sensorimotor and prefrontal beta oscillations (13-30 Hz). These changes extended to the subsequent learning phase, where phasic increases in beta power and burst rate following reward feedback were linked to smaller updates in reward estimates, with a higher anxiety-related increase explaining the attenuated belief updating. These data suggest that state anxiety alters the dynamics of beta oscillations during reward processing, thereby impairing proper updating of motor predictions when learning in unstable environments.
Feeling anxious can hinder how well someone performs a task, a phenomenon that is sometimes called ‚Äúchoking under pressure‚Äù. Anxiety may also impair a person‚Äôs ability to learn a new manual task, like juggling or playing the piano; however, it remains unclear exactly how this happens. People learn manual tasks more quickly if they can practice first, and the more someone varies their movements during these trial runs, the faster they learn afterwards. Yet, anxiety can affect movement; for example, anxious people often make repetitive motions like hand-wringing or fidgeting. There is also evidence that very anxious people may learn less from the outcomes of their actions. To understand how anxiety may affect the learning of manual tasks, Sporn et al designed experiments where people learned to play a short sequence of notes on a piano. The main experiment involved 60 participants and was split over two phases. In the first ‚Äòexploration‚Äô phase, participants had to play the piano sequence using any timing they liked and were encouraged to explore different rhythms. In the second ‚Äòlearning‚Äô phase, participants were rewarded with a higher score the closer they got to playing the notes with a certain rhythm, without being told that this was their specific goal. To see how anxiety affected performance, the participants were split into three groups. One group were told in the initial exploration phase that they would give a public talk after they completed the piano task, which reliably made them more anxious. A second group were told about the anxiety-inducing public speaking only during the learning phase; while a third group ‚Äì the controls ‚Äì were not aware of any public speaking task. People in the second group could learn the rhythm as well as the controls. Participants who were made anxious during the exploration phase, however, scored fewer points and were less likely to learn the piano sequence in the second phase. They also varied their movements less in the first phase. As a follow-up, Sporn et al. repeated the experiment with 26 people but without the initial exploration phase. This time the anxious participants were less able to learn the piano sequence and scored fewer points. This suggests that the initial exploration in the previous experiment had enabled later anxious participants to succeed in the learning phase despite being anxious. Finally, Sporn et al. also used a technique called electroencephalography (or EEG for short) to record brain activity and observed differences in participants with and without anxiety, particularly when they received their scores. The EEG signals showed that anxiety altered rhythmic patterns of brain activity called ‚Äúsensorimotor beta oscillations‚Äù, which are known to be involved in both movement and learning.",['Piano Academy - Learn Piano'],"[{'lastname': 'Sporn', 'firstname': 'Sebastian', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'School of Psychology, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.\nDepartment of Psychology, Goldsmiths University of London, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Hein', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Goldsmiths University of London, London, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Herrojo Ruiz', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, Goldsmiths University of London, London, United Kingdom.\nCenter for Cognition and Decision Making, Institute for Cognitive Neuroscience, National Research University Higher School of Economics, Moscow, Russian Federation.'}]",,"¬© 2020, Sporn et al.",10.7554/eLife.50654,eLife,"['anxiety', 'beta oscillations', 'human', 'motor learning', 'neuroscience', 'reward']",,2020-05-20,32423530,,Alterations in the amplitude and burst rate of beta oscillations impair reward-dependent motor learning in anxiety.,16

In particular, a model is introduced for the generation of such graphs, which combines spatial growth and preferential attachment. In this model the transition to heterogeneous structures is always accompanied by a change in the graph's degree-degree correlation properties: while high assortativity levels characterize the dominance of short distance couplings, long-range connectivity structures are associated with small amounts of disassortativity.

Initial learning times ranged from 17 to 120 min (mean ¬± SD: 62 ¬± 29 min). Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was used to derive the fractional anisotropy (FA), an index of white matter microstructural arrangement. A correlation analysis revealed that higher FA values were associated with faster learning of piano melodies. These effects were observed in the bilateral corticospinal tracts, bundles of axons relevant for the execution of voluntary movements, and the right superior longitudinal fasciculus, a tract important for audio-motor transformations. These results suggest that the speed with which novel complex audio-motor skills can be acquired may be determined by variability in structural properties of white matter fiber tracts connecting brain areas functionally relevant for audio-motor learning.",['Piano Academy - Learn Piano'],"[{'lastname': 'Engel', 'firstname': 'Annerose', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': ""Department of Neuroscience, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, The Netherlands; The Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW), Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, Leipzig, Germany; Cognitive and Behavioral Neuroscience Unit, D'Or Institute for Research and Education (IDOR), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.""}, {'lastname': 'Hijmans', 'firstname': 'Brenda S', 'initials': 'BS', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Cerliani', 'firstname': 'Leonardo', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Bangert', 'firstname': 'Marc', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Nanetti', 'firstname': 'Luca', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Keller', 'firstname': 'Peter E', 'initials': 'PE', 'affiliation': None}, {'lastname': 'Keysers', 'firstname': 'Christian', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': None}]",,"Copyright ¬© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",10.1002/hbm.22343,Human brain mapping,"['corticospinal tract', 'fractional anisotropy', 'inter-individual differences', 'piano learning', 'tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS)']",,2013-08-02,23904213,,Inter-individual differences in audio-motor learning of piano melodies and white matter fiber tract architecture.,16
