# GROUP 4 / E-Health Project A
### version 1.0

This repository contains the E-Health project A of the Group 4, a.y. 2021/2022 (Politecnico of Milan).
It contains 4 files:
- Guidelines: folder which contains the description of the process regading the composing of the algorithm;
- Library: folder containing benchmark and dashboard subfolders, as well as the "Recognizer.py" which is the  algorithm related to the first assignement of the project, and the "Validator.py" related to the second assignemnt
  - Benchmark contains the files:
    - Benchmark_Game_Validation.py related to the performance of the first-part algorithm
    - Benchmark_Validator.py related to the performance of the second-part algorithm
    - Benchmark_StudyType, which evaluates the performance of the second algorithm in terms of recognizing specific  study type
  - Dashboard contains the "Menu.py", which is the code related to the html dashboard
- Outputs: folder containig the output files of each section of the code
- Reports: folder containing the presentation of the all project and the reports that describe decision-making process
- Sources: folder containing the outputs of the benchmarks

All the output file we will have a ".csv" file concerning the applications which match the filters in the algorithm code.
In order to open it in a correct way, an "Excel-like" software is needed.
