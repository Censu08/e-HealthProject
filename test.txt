Guidelines of the project:

1.	Download .csv dataset called Google-Playstore (LAB04 > slide 8)
2.	Filter this dataset with all the educational categories
3.	Use google-play-scraper (LAB03 > slide 21) to select only the apps from the dataset that are games
    (filter with genreId = "GAME_" while using the apps' ID)
4.	Use google-play-scraper (LAB03 > slide 21) to enrich the dataset

At the end, we should have a database composed of serious games and their characteristics:
    - Title (name)
    - Description
    - Learning category
    - Ratings
    - Expert validation
    - Reviews
    - Age range (3 categories, else NaN)
    - Feedback ratio (rating counts/installs)
    - Price (0 --> free, else)

5. Clean the database by deleting some columns and selecting only games with specific features

Deleted columns:
    - Minimum installs
    - Maximum installs
    - Free
    - Currency
    - Size
    - Minimum Android
    - Developper Id/Website/Email
    - Released
    - Content rating
    - Editors Choice
    - Scraped Time

Features:
    - rating counts > ? (according to the median of rating counts)
    - ratings > ? % above the average(all the apps) --> look at the average first to decide the %
    - feedback ratio > ? (according to the numbers)
    - last updated < 6 months
    - privacy policy presented

6. Transform the dataset into a .csv or .json file

7. Import it and build it on SQLite or others
