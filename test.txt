Guidelines of the project:

1.	Download .csv dataset called Google-Playstore (LAB04 > slide 8)
2.	Filter this dataset with all the educational categories
3.	Use google-play-scraper (LAB03 > slide 21) to select only the apps from the dataset that are games
    (filter with genreId = "GAME_" while using the apps' ID)
4.	Use play-scraper (LAB03 > slide 21) to enrich the dataset (add age range...)

At the end, we should have a database composed of serious games and their characteristics:
    - Title
    - Description
    - Learning category
    - Ratings
    - Expert validation
    - Reviews
    - Age range

5. Clean the database by selecting only games with specific features

Features:
    - ratings > ? % above the average(all the apps) --> look at the average first to decide the %
    -


6. Transform the dataset into a .csv or .json file

7. Import it on SQLite or others
