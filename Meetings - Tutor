Problems to solve:

    - Apps ID in Google-Playstore.csv don't necessarily match with the ones in google-play-scraper
      (Is it ok to use try/except?)
    - Explain the strategy of cleaning the initial dataset by removing the problematic lines
    - For loop to find the games: very long, is it ok?
    - Where can we find the learning category, the expert validation or the age?
    - What do we need to put in the dataset at the end, exactly?
    - What is the last step of Phase I exactly?
